metamorphosis

The next thing that one notices is that what moves can
come to rest and what rests can start to move. Also, it
is possible to visualize something that one has seen outside,
like a tree or a spoon, later on in the mind. In other
words, the elements can transform into each other.

What causes these changes? Whatever it is, it must be
something fundamental, like the four elements. So let me
simply call it the fifth element, e5.

Free will seems to be a part of e5. It is possible to
lift a spoon and then to throw it away, i.e. to get something
outside that rests into motion (ero->emo).
However, free will cannot be identical to e5, as some things
are much harder to control (try lifting a tree) and things
transform all the time without conscious influence.

Freedom inside the mind seems larger than outside. It is
much easier to lift a tree in the mind, than a real tree.
But let me tackle things from a different angle:
Outside on average more things rest than move, while inside
the mind, things are almost always more flowing.

For example,
a tree is at rest in most situations, except for a little
movement of leaves and maybe branches. But if
you close your eyes and try to imagine a tree at rest, it
will get very hard after a few seconds not to deviate to other
thoughts and to keep the tree at rest.

In conclusion, on average outside activity is needed to
get things moving, while inside activity is needed to
keep things at rest. More abstractly, emo and eri are
thus active, ero and emi are passive. Also, what is outside
resists motion on average more than what is inside.
So emo and ero are hard (out), emi and eri are soft (in).

emo moves outside active  hard
ero rests outside passive hard
emi moves inside  passive soft
eri rests inside  active  soft
e5  transforms the above elements

leads

- If free will is a part of e5, what is the rest?
Cause and effect, fate, destiny, the free will of others?
Quantum mechanics has relativized the first assumption
somewhat, or maybe not.

- What property of the issue of free will or not
leads to millions of variations when thinking about it?
Could it possibly even be literally the effect of many
"transformations" in the mind, whatever that may mean
precisely?

- Freedom to lift a spoon does not
automatically mean freedom of choice whether to want to
lift the spoon or not.

- When I say that outside more things rest than move,
I mean this in a very specific sense: Relative macroscopic
motion at time scales that human beings can register.

At long time scales, all things move; microscopically
everything is in motion, as heat is nothing but
random motion of atoms or molecules. When I turn my head,
all objects move, but relative motion between them remains small.

- The present approach to nature is consequently centered
on the human perspective, on direct experience of nature.
Modern science usually differs from that by trying to pick
a point of view from which a problems is easy to describe.

The oldest example for this is astronomy that has been greatly
simplified by solar centered calculations instead of using many
arbitrary epicycles in geocentric calculations.

- Modern science is a very valuable companion for the
present approach, especially for helping to exclude naive
mistakes.

- Can my observations about motion, activity and
hardness outside and inside be formalized and thus proven?
How would such a mathematical representation look like?
What assumptions would it be based on?
