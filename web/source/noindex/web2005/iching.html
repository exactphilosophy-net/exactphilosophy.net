i ching

India and China also know 5 elements. But let me instead
consider something older and more fundamental, namely the
8 trigrams of the Chinese Book of Changes, the I Ching.

heaven, strong, creative, father
earth, devoted/yielding,  receptive, mother
thunder, inciting movement, arousing, 1st son
water, dangerous, abysmal, 2nd son
mountain, resting, keeping still, 3rd son
wind/wood, penetrating, gentle, 1st daughter
fire, light-giving, clinging, 2nd daughter
lake, joyful, joyous, 3rd daughter

Seems they resemble the Greek elements in pairs,
namely heaven-wind (air), earth-mountain,  fire-thunder and
water-lake. Let me rearrange them into another table:

heaven    air   rests male
wind/wood air   moves female
mountain  earth rests male
earth     earth moves female
fire      fire  rests female
thunder   fire  moves male
lake      water rests female
water     water moves male

Interestingly, if one selects the trigrams that correspond
to the Greek elements, i.e. resting air and earth, moving
fire and water, this selects exactly the male trigrams.

- The I Ching is a divination system. By tossing coins
or drawing yarrow sticks, one determines hexagrams (two
trigrams) that are given meanings in the text of the I Ching.

- It appears that the fifth element is somehow contained
in the duality of the trigrams. Can it be made more specific
in which way exactly?

- A useful hint might be the following quote from the
introduction of I Ching or Book of Changes.
Richard Wilhelm. English by Cary F. Baynes. Penguin Books.
2003.

"The eight trigrams are symbols standing for changing
transitional states; they are images that are constantly
undergoing change. Attention centers not on things in their
state of being---as is chiefly the case in the Occident---but
upon their movements in change. The eight trigrams therefore
are not representations of things as such but of their
tendencies in movement."

- How about putting the four elements into a circle
in which they transform into each other? Then there
would be 8 possible transitions (4 forward, 4 backward).
