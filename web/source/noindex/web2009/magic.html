<h1>magic carpets</h1>
<p>
How logic and association can be used to creatively explore
symbolic systems, like astrology, in a fairly structured and
controlled way. Presents lots of new cool examples, mostly
related to Western tropical astrology, but the method would
be generally useful and could likely be formalized...
</p>
<h2>Association and Logic</h2>
<p>
Here are a few associations with the star sign Cancer:
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
Cancer is the latin word for crab, which leads to the hard
shell (but soft inside) of the animal, the "house" that
some crabs are carrying around for protection, the water
and sea it lives in or nearby, and from sea you get to tides
and to sun and moon which cause tides; Cancer also leads to
the moon as the astrological planet who rules Cancer, and,
because Cancer is the fourth star sign of the zodiac, to
the fourth astrological house, which is often related to
mother and father, who are generally associated with moon
and sun, respectively.
</p><p>
These few paths reveal already several themes related to
Cancer. A <em>theme</em> is essentially just a word or a
group of words that is relatively close to the starting point
(Cancer in this example) and to which several independent
paths lead. <em>Protection</em> would be a theme, since
you can get there from house and shell. Or <em>water</em>,
because Cancer is a water sign and the animal lives in or
near water. And, maybe a bit astonishingly to some astrologers
at first sight, <em>sun</em> starts to emerge also as a
theme for Cancer.
</p><p>
Liz Greene recognizes the sun theme for Cancer in
<em>The Astrology of Fate</em> (Weiser, 1984). In ancient
Egypt, the star sign Cancer was a beetle and it was
"equated with the creator god Atum, a form of the sun god
because the beetle pushes its dung-ball before it as Atum
pushes the solar ball across the sky". And a bit later:
"The cusp of the fourth house [...] has long been
associated with the end of life; here it is also imagined
as the beginning, for this is the point of the sun at midnight
when the old day dies and the new day is born [...]
This deeply mystical linking of Cancer with the very seed
of life connects it not only with the primordial mother,
but with the Father as well [...]".
</p><p>
In the following, I will typically not dwell in such detail
on every association I make. That would make this text very
long and usually deviate from the point. Specific themes are
explored in more detail in other parts of this web site,
see <em>elementary star signs</em> and <em>reflectivity</em>.
</p><p>
Let me start abstracting from the previous example.
</p><p>
Association is based on similarities between some kind of
entities. Such entities always have names and the similarities
are the attributes of these names. Hence, you can do
association based entirely on language as a <em>cultural mirror</em>
of the world and its history. In other words, the associations
with Cancer above are just a very tiny fragment of a universal
web of all associations between all words in all languages
and including also all other symbols.
</p><p>
Language has grown over millennia, so it contains not only
present knowledge and conceptions about the world, but also
very ancient know-how or superstitions - in any case many
things that contemporary individuals are often not aware of.
But more related to that later.
</p><p>
Association does not make any absolute statements. Every word
can be associated with every word, it is just so that the path
between words can be very long. Hence every word is a theme in
relation to every word - to some degree. In particular, both
a word and its opposite(s) are always a theme to some degree.
For example, Cancer is a cardinal sign, thus often <em>eager</em>
to start something, but since Cancer is also a water sign
and water is a passive element, there is also <em>reluctance</em>
in Cancer. So it cannot be said that generally Cancer is
<em>either</em> eager or reluctant, only that this represents
a theme, an issue for Cancer and that it will depend on more
precise circumstances which will show more. Often for Cancer
reluctant phases in which symbolically water pressure builds
up within the shell will be followed by outbursts, like a geyser,
sometimes gently, sometimes maybe explosively, revolutionary.
</p><p>
In logical thinking opposites strictly exclude each other.
If <em>A</em> is true and <em>B</em> follows from <em>A</em>,
then the opposite of <em>B</em> does not follow from <em>A</em>.
However, it should be mentioned that this only works as long
as there is no self-reference. For example, both "this
sentence has five words" and "this sentence has not five words"
are true. So, questions like "Am I eager or reluctant?"
might not be resolvable by logic alone. It should be noted that
associatively, opposites can still <em>practically</em> exclude
each other: If there are more and shorter paths to one opposite
than to the other.
</p><p>
People who are using logic often make the mistake of forgetting
the <em>'if A then'</em> part of <em>'if A then B'</em>.
<em>B</em> is only true under the precondition of <em>A</em>,
if your perception of preconditions is false, then <em>B</em>
may or may not be true. That is often a main reason for
misunderstandings between men and women, like this: Max has
a certain preconception of what he is talking about with
Joanne, but then Joanne says something that "does not compute",
something apparently completely illogical or in direct
contradiction to Max's preconceptions. After a bit more
conversation, Max starts to realize that Joanne had associatively
expanded the frame, even without being consciously fully aware
of it. In light of the broader picture, Joanne's previous
statement suddenly makes sense, also from a purely logical
point of view.
</p><p>
Logic is even more limited in a sense than that: As G&ouml;odel
has shown, in any (closed) logical system, there can be logical
statements that may be true or may be false, but whether they
are true or not cannot be judged <em>within</em> the system,
but only in a larger system. In that sense, associatively
broadening the frame can even provide additional insights
into the original frame.
</p><p>
Let me get back to language as a cultural and historical
mirror of the world. There is just <em>one</em> huge web
of associations, which includes all words in all languages
and other symbols. This web reminds strongly of the
<em>fabric of fate</em>, which the three fates are weaving
in Greek mythology.
</p><p>
Not too directly, though. What the fates are weaving is the
strands of life of individuals, while the web of associations
is rather a top view onto that generational tree, which shows
still some laws of fate. The life strands of people are
mirrored by the etymology of words, by their evolution and
changes over time.
</p><p>
In any case, the web of associations contains not only
conscious knowledge about the world, but taps also into the
reservoir of the collective unconscious, even and maybe even
particularly in cases where association seems to contradict
contemporary science.
</p><p>
That is so because scientific theories are essentially logic
based on observed reality. If preconditions change due to
new experimental data, also the logical consequences of
science can change. Such additional knowledge about reality,
a broader frame, may already be subliminally present in the
current web of associations, hence looking into associations
may also provide interesting clues for future science.
</p><p>
Or in other words, in analogy to the previous example,
generally Max stands for science and pure consciousness,
while Joanne represents associative and often partially
unconscious approaches, including also astrology.
</p><p>
Let me leave it at that and present a few of my favorite
associations, many related to western astrology, but some
also related to association itself. Many of them will help
to form a simple toolbox that I will then apply to various
topics in the <em>reflectivity</em> section.
</p><p>
Note that - obviously in light of what has been said so
far - none of these ideas is intended to be <em>exclusive</em>
with already existing common associations. Many of them are
simpler approaches to associations that are already widely
recognized. Others are just minor complementary views, which
can maybe help to complete a theme or might only be suitable
in specific situations. Often I will quickly mention
corresponding mainstream associations, too.
</p>
<h2>Elementary Cycles</h2>
<p>
I like to arrange the elements in a cycle, like this:
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
The cycle starts with fire, culminates with air, flows down
with water, rests with earth, and finally starts again. This
fits well with the notion from the <em>elementary philosophy</em>
section that fire and water move, while air and earth rest.
The motion is up for the light element fire and down for
the heavy element water. Air rests actively high up,
while earth rests passively low down.
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">1</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">moves</td>
<td class="text">light</td>
<td class="text">--> moves up</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">2</td>
<td class="text">air</td>
<td class="text">rests</td>
<td class="text">light</td>
<td class="text">--> rests up</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">3</td>
<td class="text">water</td>
<td class="text">moves</td>
<td class="text">heavy</td>
<td class="text">--> moves down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">4</td>
<td class="text">earth</td>
<td class="text">rests</td>
<td class="text">heavy</td>
<td class="text">--> rests down</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
So the cycle suggests 1-fire, 2-air, 3-water, 4-earth, and,
since it is a cycle, the number five is in a way again a bit
like fire, but a <em>reborn</em> fire with more experience,
because it has already seen all elements and transformations
of the cycle. This fits associatively quite well with general
perceptions of the fifth element and also with the definition
I gave in the <em>elementary philosophy</em> section, in which
I defined the fifth element as the transformations between
the first four.
</p>
<h2>Day and Year</h2>
<p>
The general cycle can be associated with any specific
cycles you fancy, like, for example, day and year:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">1</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">sunrise/morning</td>
<td class="text">spring (equinox)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">2</td>
<td class="text">air</td>
<td class="text">noon/afternoon</td>
<td class="text">summer (solstice)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">3</td>
<td class="text">water</td>
<td class="text">sunset/evening</td>
<td class="text">autumn (equinox)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">4</td>
<td class="text">earth</td>
<td class="text">midnight/night</td>
<td class="text">winter (solstice)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
I will make a few relatively astonishing astrological
associations from there a bit later.
</p><p>
For the moment note that Aristotle suggests a different
assignment of elements to seasons:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">spring</td>
<td class="text">air</td>
<td class="text">wet --> dry</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">summer</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">hot --> cold</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">autumn</td>
<td class="text">earth</td>
<td class="text">dry --> wet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">winter</td>
<td class="text">water</td>
<td class="text">cold --> hot</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The idea is that in spring, as it gets warmer, the air
dries out and thus becomes fire, which gets colder towards
autumn, becoming earth, which then becomes wet towards
winter, water, and so on. Aristotle's model fits quite
well with some star signs, especially with the ones of
winter. For Pisces and Aquarius the connection to water
is obvious, whereas for Capricorn one has to be aware
that he is often depicted as a <em>goatfish</em>, a
mythological creature with a fish tail and the upper
body of a goat.
</p><p>
Needless to say, I hope, that Aristotle's views and mine
are not mutually exclusive, they simply superimpose by
association. In that sense, let me also mention that it is
not uncommon to associate each season with the cardinal
star sign that starts it, i.e. spring-Aries-fire,
summer-Cancer-water, autumn-Libra-air and
winter-Capricorn-earth.
</p>
<h2>Elementary Levels</h2>
<p>
Let me add this to the picture:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">1</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">individual imagination</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">2</td>
<td class="text">air</td>
<td class="text">logical consequences</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">3</td>
<td class="text">water</td>
<td class="text">collective wishes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">4</td>
<td class="text">earth</td>
<td class="text">physical reality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">5</td>
<td class="text">ether</td>
<td class="text">transcending reality</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The basic idea in this table is that there are different
aspects of the world with different strengths. Logic beats
individual ideas of how the world might be. Collective
wishes can beat logic by expanding the frame of preconditions,
but only within the limits of physical reality. All cultures
place some things above physical reality, things like
philosophy and religion, etc.
</p><p>
This simple image will be the key to many hopefully
interesting ideas in the following, a bit like magic.
</p><p>
The four elements are commonly also associated with the
four points of the compass. In the past, before there were
airplanes and the like, the four elements symbolized thus
also the limitation of mortals down onto a flat Earth.
Religion is the escape up into the third dimension, the
number five points up to god or the gods, while the number
six points down, hence the popular Christian association
of six with the devil. Christ nailed to the cross is
literally bound by earth, limited by the four elements,
but then symbolically saved by the fifth when he ascends
to heaven.
</p>
<h2>Ancient China and Transformation</h2>
<p>
Let me associatively derive some very interesting properties
of the numbers 6 to 10 from the smaller numbers. In my model
of the star signs, fire signs, for example, are stages in
the transition earth-fire-air. If you add the corresponding
numbers, you get 4+1+2 = 7. This provides an association
between the number 7 and the transformation of fire. If you
do the same for all four elements, you get:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">6</td>
<td class="text">1+2+3</td>
<td class="text">transformation of air</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">7</td>
<td class="text">4+1+2</td>
<td class="text">transformation of fire</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">8</td>
<td class="text">1+4+3</td>
<td class="text">transformation of earth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">9</td>
<td class="text">4+3+2</td>
<td class="text">transformation of water</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">10</td>
<td class="text">2 x 5</td>
<td class="text">meta transformation</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This strange way of associating things may seem "out
of bounds" to some readers, but no association is wrong.
And if you have the courage to look further, you can
find this very astonishing correlation with Chinese themes:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">6</td>
<td class="text">6 x 6</td>
<td class="text">36 Stratagems of War</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">7</td>
<td class="text">7 x 7</td>
<td class="text">???</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">8</td>
<td class="text">8 x 8</td>
<td class="text">64 Hexagrams of the I Ching</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">9</td>
<td class="text">9 x 9</td>
<td class="text">81 parts of the Tao Te Ching</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
There is a strong association with water in the 81 short
texts of the Tao Te Ching. The I Ching, in contrast, is
more structured, more earthy. And its subtitle
<em>Book of Changes</em> links it explicitly to transformation.
But there is more. In ancient China, it was apparently
common that the land of farmers was arranged in a 3 x 3 matrix:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">o</td>
<td class="text">o</td>
<td class="text">o</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">o</td>
<td class="text">&bull;</td>
<td class="text">o</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">o</td>
<td class="text">o</td>
<td class="text">o</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The outer 8 fields were cultivated by individual families,
while the ninth central field was common property and
contained the well. The Chinese word for well is very
similar to the "ching" in I Ching and Tao Te Ching.
So the well provides water (collective wishes) to the
collective, making the outer fields (earth) fertile.
</p><p>
The 36 Stratagems may be less known. They provide a concrete
list of tactical and strategical advice how to win in battles.
The logic (air) of war. I am not aware of anything that comes
in 49 = 7 x 7 parts in ancient China.
</p>
<h2>Elements and Senses</h2>
<p>
I think this association between elements and senses
fits in several interesting ways:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">1</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">eyes</td>
<td class="text">see</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">2</td>
<td class="text">air</td>
<td class="text">ears</td>
<td class="text">hear</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">3</td>
<td class="text">water</td>
<td class="text">nostrils+tongue</td>
<td class="text">smell/taste</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">4</td>
<td class="text">earth</td>
<td class="text">hands+feet</td>
<td class="text">touch</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In order to see, you need light, hence fire. Hearing is often used
when communicating with others via language, which is
associated with the element air. Smell and touch can be
very pleasurable experiences, hence they are related to
feelings and water, but they also serve to probe if something
is good to eat or drink. So there is also suspicion,
reminding of the middle water sign, Scorpio. Finally,
physical reality is mainly touched by hands and feet.
</p><p>
So touch is mainly experienced with 4 things, two hands
and two feet; smell and touch come from 3 things, two
nostrils and one tongue; sound comes in via 2 ears.
The only thing that does not fit so well in that respect
is that people have two eyes, not just 1.
</p><p>
Of course, just because one or maybe a few pieces of
association do not fit, you do not "throw out the baby
theme with the bath water". The theme still remains.
</p>
<h2>Psyche's Tasks</h2>
<p>
The famous four tasks posed by goddess Venus to beautiful
mortal <em>Psyche</em> (see leads) are maybe best
associated with the four elements as follows:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">1st task</td>
<td class="text">sort seeds</td>
<td class="text">earth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">2nd task</td>
<td class="text">collect fleece</td>
<td class="text">water</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">3rd task</td>
<td class="text">get water from Styx</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">4th task</td>
<td class="text">get ointment from underworld</td>
<td class="text">air</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Her first task consists of sorting a huge pile of different
seeds into individual piles. Ants come to her help and sort
the seeds. For the second task, she has to collect fleece
from fierce rams that live near a river. She manages to do
so by waiting until night when the rams are asleep and collects
fleece that have stuck to thorny bushes. The third task is to
fill a goblet with water from the river Styx, the river that
gods swear by. This is very difficult, as the river is circular
and surrounded by steep, sharp rocks and guarded by monsters.
Zeus sends an eagle who flies down to the river from above
and fills the goblet. The fourth task is the most complex one:
Get a box of ointments from Proserpina, queen of the underworld.
By sticking to a detailed plan, Psyche also succeeds at that.
</p><p>
The associations with Psyche herself are clear: She is the
personification of the human psyche. Her tasks symbolize thus
different tasks that life poses to the mind.
</p><p>
The assignment of elements I propose fits very well with two
things. For one, the order is about the natural order of
elements in terms of height. Water is always above some piece
of land, and so on. Maybe not a perfect fit, but most likely
the order earth-water-fire-air is the most natural one in
that sense. What fits extremely well, though, is the tasks
in relation to my elementary model of the star signs. Let me
just look more closely at one task here.
</p><p>
The third task, for example, is solved by overview, by mentally
rising into the air into which fire signs are transforming,
and it is also made clear that the "grail" (goblet) itself,
in terms of its matter, the earth that fire signs are coming
from, is not important; what counts is its contents, a bit
of eternity symbolized by the water from the Styx. Also water,
because that is the element not present in the transformation
of the fire signs in my model.
</p>
<h2>Angles and Seasons</h2>
<p>
Let me map my cycle of the elements as applied to day
and year to corresponding astrological concepts:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">1</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">ascendent (AC)</td>
<td class="text">spring signs</td>
</tr>
<tr>

The ascendent is typically associated with the outer visual
appearance of a person, with what you can immediately see,
hence fire. In contrast, the medium coeli, the zenith, is
often considered to be related to the <em>public image</em>
of a person, to how you are perceived by people who do not
know you in person. At least in the past, before television,
a public image was typically conveyed by what you said and
what you wrote. Hence the MC is more abstract than the AC,
and, of course, this fits well with the element air.

<h2>Astrological Quaternity</h2>
<p>
Numbering of star signs, houses and aspects is obvious, but
for planets that is less clear. I would like to present a
numbering of planets here that has some interesting features
in relation to the natural order of the others and in relation
to what has been associated with numbers and elements so far,
even though not all parts of it fit equally well:

Typically, on astrological charts, Mercury is at 3, Venus
at 4 and Mars at 5. The usual order is thus first sun and
moon, the big ones as seen in the sky, then planets in
order of their apparent speed in the sky. Plus there are
other links of planets to signs, like by rulership or
exaltation.
</p><p>
The order listed above, however, has some very interesting
properties if you look at the whole table. Take the number
three, for example. Trines are usually considered to be harmonic,
but also passive. The harmony and the passivity in the sense
of letting maybe others do things for you, fit well with the
goddess of love, Venus. Liz Greene considers the passivity
of trines even fated, which fits with the element water
(collective wishes) and with Venus.
</p><p>
Squares are perceived as disharmonic, as disruptive, as
forcing to act, and also as stiff, as either staying as
they are or breaking. This fits quite well with the dry
and thus hard element earth, with the god of war, Mars,
and it reminds of Cancer's mentioned theme of how to be
cardinal...
</p><p>
Related to the numbers 3 and 4 is also the idea that
"the fourth is different". The number 3 is just a bit
smaller than &pi; = 3.141..., the number that links
the diameter of a circle to its circumference, with the
circle often symbolizing perfect harmony. Since 3 is a
bit smaller than that, it is quite harmonic, but also
incomplete. The number 4 breaks the harmony, but contains
also about 1/7 of what is needed to make the circle complete.
</p><p>
Planet Mercury is on average retrograde during about one
5th of the time. And its
association with transformation is close to the fifth element.
Quintiles are often related to creativity and talent, themes
also prominent for Leo and the fifth house, and so on.
</p><p>
(I found this order of planets a few years ago with an internet
search and on that site it said that this had been the order
commonly used in the past, but I could not find this site again
afterwards, nor any other source that would use this order, Thus
I am not sure if what that site said is true. As a meta
association, this fits five and Mercury, like a glove. Gloves
are for hands, which have 5 fingers, and hands are in astrology
commonly associated with the star sign Gemini, which is ruled
by Mercury, etc.)
</p><p>
The fit for these three planets is not perfect, though.
Especially Gemini-3 seems not to fit well. Gemini is ruled by
Mercury, who helped the fates to create the alphabet. Fate
comes from <em>fatum</em>, spoken. Hence language and
communication have a fated angle, too, but I have never
seen someone associate Gemini with harmony.
</p><p>
Of course, a lot more associations could be made from these
three numbers alone, not to speak of the others. Let me just
mention something with regard to the numbers 8 and 9, before
moving on. Neptune rules the sea (water), and Uranus is an
earthy Titan in mythology, married to his mother Gaia ('Earth'),
even though there is some ambivalence with regard to the
other element in both gods. 
</p><p>
But there is also another concept from astrology that can be
linked to 8 and 9. Before the discoveries of Uranus and Neptune,
the only other 'object' besides the seven planets that was
shown in birth charts was typically the lunar nodes, the points
where the apparent path of the moon crosses the ecliptic (and
they still appear on almost every chart drawn today). So, it
makes sense to place them after Saturn, at positions 8 and 9.
This association suggests a strong correlation between 8 and 9,
stronger than, say, between 9 and 10, which fits also well
with the Chinese associations I made previously.
</p>
<h2>Hercules and Houses</h2>
<p>
Direct associations with astrological houses are twofold.
They lead to the word "house" and to its number. Hence one
would expect also meanings of houses to reflect that. However,
since my personal experience with astrological houses is
limited, let me just present a few teasers here.
</p><p>
<em>A house is a neutral arena of life, which we furnish
according to the nature of our own substance. Manilius described
a horoscopic house as a <em>templum</em>, and this
ancient term can be helpful in understanding what the houses mean.
<em>Templum</em> is also the word for a temple,
which in Manilius' time was an empty building or designated
sacred area, devoid of numinosity until the cult statue of
the god was placed within.
-- Liz Greene, The Astrological Neptune (Weiser, 2000)</em>
</p><p>
As Robert Graves writes in <em>The Greek Myths</em>, Roman
conquerors even went so far as stealing cult statues from Greek
temples and bringing them home. Some languages use different
words for astrological houses. In German, for example, also
"Feld" (field) is common. But astrological houses seem always
to be a place, a piece of earth, plus something more abstract,
like air, that can be there or not, like if there was a planet
(god) in the house (temple) at birth.
</p><p>
This relates houses maybe most strongly to the element earth.
Air is the missing element in my model of the transformations
between elements, the element opposite of earth in my and also
in Aristotle's cycle of the elements.
</p><p>
Hercules' name means "glory of Hera". Greek goddess Hera
corresponds to Roman Juno, who gave her name to the month of
June, in which Cancer, the fourth sign is born. The word
<em>labor</em> is also related to child birth, which is a
strong theme for Hera and Cancer in mythology. So, maybe not
too unlikely, Hercules' labors are not only for Hera's glory,
but also closely related to houses.
</p><p>
Hercules' fifth labor consists of cleaning the stables of
Augeias within a single day. The solution invokes numbers in
sequence: First comes the idea (fire, 1); then, with the advice
and help of two people, Hercules breaches the walls of the stable
on opposite sides (2); then he redirects two rivers into a
single one (3=2+1) and lets it flow through the stable; the
water washes out the dung (earth, 4) and completes the labor.
Transformation of elements (5).
</p><p>
Other labors fit quite well, too, even though their order is
not universal in all versions of the myth.
</p><p>
Maybe houses are a bit like levels in a video game. Maybe
they require the ones within to solve some tasks in order to
be able to move on to the next level, at least when planets
transit houses. Or maybe not, just teasing, with both a
joking and a serious eye, though...
</p>
<h2>Mirrored Opposites</h2>
<p>
Opposite signs in the zodiac, Aries-Libra, Taurus-Scorpio,
etc., are considered to be in many ways different in
opposite ways. For example, Leo egoistic, but Aquarius
altruistic, and Virgo analytic, but Pisces synthetic.
Oppositions are often also viewed in astrology to involve
the psychological <em>projection</em> of one's own inner
issues onto an outer person or situation. Oppositions are always between
fire-air or earth-water, thus always between a wet and a
dry element. Since I relate wet/dry to in/out under
<em>elementary philosophy</em>, the following idea emerges:
</p><p>
What if opposite signs in the zodiac are to some degree mutual
mirror images with respect to in/out ?
</p><p>
Let me explain what exactly I mean: Virgo's approach towards
outer reality is typically seen as analyzing and sorting it,
while Pisces is often seen as reluctant to touch anything,
to just let it go its natural path. But likely that outer
pair Virgo-order and Pisces-chaos is reflected inside by
Virgo-chaos and Pisces-order. As soon as you start to analyze,
your head quickly fills up with lots of details, hence inside,
at least at first, disorder increases. Conversely, there is a
great clarity of mind in Pisces, as has been noted, for example,
by Liz Greene in <em>Star Signs for Lovers</em>, likely because
Pisces avoids to try to sort things out. Whatever Pisces
encounters in life is often quickly filled into a virtual
"bin" in the head. That is why Pisces gets bored so quickly.
The different minds of Pisces and Virgo likely also show in
their approach to drugs. To Pisces, drugs can often be a
welcome escape from dull clarity, while more mental chaos
is often the last thing Virgo would want.
</p>
<h2>Adaptive Astrology</h2>
<p>
Assume, for example, you are supposed to analyze the birth
chart of someone born in 1980 in Germany. The individual
is German, has German ancestors, relatives and friends.
Which house system would you use ? The one you always use
or the most common one in Germany, hence likely the Koch
house system in this case ?
</p><p>
Let me first generalize a bit before I attempt to answer
that question. First of all, different house systems may
not necessarily be exclusive. The reality of what a person
feels may just as well be a superposition of different
house systems, in accordance with the principle of association.
</p><p>
A German in Germany who knows essentially only Germans is
bound by that environment, in time and place. Casting a chart
using methods from the Renaissance, for example, would likely
not mirror the forces on the individual that well. However,
at no time in history is everything conscious, so some
existing influences and themes may be easier to see when
using a different system.
</p><p>
Most people usually only contact astrologers (if ever) when
they are deeply stuck in a situation, desperate to get out of it.
This brings in the general element of expanding the frame,
initiated by the individual. Since the individual has made
that first step, probably the astrologer should not adapt too
much, in order to be better able to see a solution beyond the
frame. That said, in this specific case, a look at the chart
at least <em>also</em> using Koch houses would still seem
to be a good idea.
</p><p>
Extending the idea, should one maybe use different methods
when analyzing the chart of a Capricorn than the chart of a
Libra, for example ? Maybe. Possibly such adaptive methods
that derive from simple principles would even be necessary
in order to be able to formally prove astrology in scientific
experiments. Or maybe not.
</p>
<h2>Formal Association</h2>
<p>
In order to answer questions like the previous one,
a formal scientific method for doing association that
is generally accepted would be ideal...
</p><p>
The principles of association seem quite simple, so that
likely computers could easily be taught to apply them a
trillion times, or more. Actually, what contemporary internet
search engines are doing, is mainly based on association.
You find web sites first that contain most of your search
terms as closely together as possible. In fact, I often use
search engines to explore symbolic themes. The hints I get
from a search lead me then to further search terms and
eventually themes start to emerge.
</p><p>
Astrologically, all of this is likely quite a bit related
to Sagittarius and Pluto's passage through it between about
1997 and 2008. British astrologer Charles Harvey actually
predicted this, also in light of Uranus and Neptune in Aquarius,
though not in its full global magnitude, in <em>Anima Mundi</em>
(CPA Press, 2002). The matrix of associations is perpendicular
to the generational tree (Virgo), like a top view on a tree,
or a bottom view at its roots.

<h2>leads</h2>
<ul class="leads">
<li class="leads">In terms of the ideas under
<em>long-range feelings</em> - even if there is no such
thing - association gets a cause: Unconscious collective
beliefs at time and place of birth and during life would
shape the forces on each individual and so they would
often naturally mirror associations quite closely.
</li>
<li class="leads">Quite a few ideas here, and especially a certain
overview over common contemporary associations, are based
on my experience in <em>usenet</em>, from posting about
1001 posts between 2002 and essentially 2008, and from
reading other people's posts.
</li>
<li class="leads">In <em>A few new discoveries in physics</em>, which
I first published in 2002, I first formulated the general
associative principle in an even more precise way, linking
it also implicitly to the axis Aries-Libra of the corresponding
age, see H19. Also the numbering of elements in the order
1-fire, 2-air, 3-water and 4-earth was first mentioned there.

<li class="leads">Psyche's tasks are a short segment in the tale of
<em>Cupid and Psyche</em>, which, in turn, is a story told
by an old woman in Lucius' Apuleius <em>Metamorphoses</em>,
also known as <em>The Golden Ass</em>, from the second
century CE, in which the hero, Lucius, is turned into an ass
and goes through many tribulations.
</li>
<li class="leads">The 7 x 7 matrix in ancient China may be related to 
Tao Yin, an ancient form of physical and breathing
exercises intended to achieve spiritual effects; thus body
(earth) gets into outward motion (fire), leading to more air.
Tao Yin is the precursor of Qigong and T'ai Chi. The <em>qi</em>/<em>chi</em>
in these, the energy flow through the body, is apparently
also similar to how the number 7 is pronounced in Chinese.
