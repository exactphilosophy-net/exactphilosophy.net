<h1>elementary star signs</h1>
<p>
Reveals an interesting structure in the signs of the western
zodiac, of which astonishingly nobody is aware.
</p>
<h2>First Example: Leo and Fire Signs</h2>
<p>
<em>But the lion is a stage in a process, as Jung suggests;
and it is this process or pattern which brings us into the sphere
of the 'fate' of Leo. It would seem [...] that there is an
alchemical work to be performed. The Lion is not permitted to
remain in its bestial form, but must give way to something other.
- Liz Greene, The Astrology of Fate</em>
</p><p>
In my model, Leo's transformation mentioned in the above
quote is between elements: earth is turned by fire to air.
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
The archetypal image is simply a burning fire that transforms
wood (earth) to smoke (air). More precisely, Aries is a young
fire, made mainly of earth, with not much fire, yet, and almost
no air, yet. Sagittarius, in turn, is an old fire, consisting
mainly of air, with not much fire remaining and almost no
earth left. Leo is in between, a fire at its peak, with a lot
of fire, and less but mutually about equal amounts of earth
and air.
</p><p>
Astonishingly, this simple model is by far not simplistic.
</p><p>
Let me visit a few themes related to Leo and the fire signs,
before exposing the model in a bit more structured way, while
also extending it to all signs and elements.
</p><p>
As a primary source for themes and myths, I will use what
Liz Greene associates with star signs in <em>The Astrology of Fate</em>
(Weiser, 1984), in chapter 8, <em>Myth and the Zodiac</em>.
Unless otherwise mentioned, quotes will be from there.
</p><p>
A central theme in the story of Parsifal, and thus also for Leo,
is the wound of the fisher king. Young Parsifal first fails to
ask the right question and only after much work manages to heal
the king and take his place.
</p><p>
In my model, the wound of the fisher king is simply the human body
(earth) that is wounded by the fire of life, as any human body is
doomed to die one day. Only what is learned in life, can be
formulated in words (air) and can thus be passed on to later
generations, thus becomes immortal in a way. So there is a
transformation from mortal body to immortal soul, or a transition
animal->human/king->god.
</p><p>
This explains why conscious awareness (air) is such an
important thing to learn for Parsifal. The wound of the
fisher king is in the lower part of his body, afflicting
his power to reproduce, thus related to the more instinctive
and animal-like side of the king (earth).
</p><p>
While the wound of the fisher king can be healed, the wound
in a piece of mythology associated with Sagittarius, cannot:
The centaur Cheiron was accidentally injured by his friend
Hercules with a poisoned arrow in the lower part of his body.
But since Cheiron is immortal, he cannot die. This fits very
well with the model, where the fire has burned almost down,
i.e. the earth (human body) is gone, and only knowledge and
wisdom remain. 
</p><p>
It is also fitting that the wound is inflicted by Hercules,
who was usually wearing a lion's pelt. Cheiron in the end
consciously choses to trade his immortality for releasing
Prometheus from Hades.
</p><p>
Some cookbook attributes of the fire signs: Aries is considered
to be rather secretive, while Sagittarius is known for his
openness, and Leo is likely somewhere in between, sometimes
being open and sometimes not. This fits with decreasing
mortality (less earth). What damage can others do to you if
most of you has become immortal (air) anyway. Related to that
is also the theme of generosity, which is apparently also
increasing from Aries to Sagittarius, in the model for the
same reason.
</p><p>
The sun god Apollo "is an image of the power of consciousness,
vested in it by the Self, which breaks the 'curse'". A family
curse can be seen as rooted in earth, in the tree of ancestors,
in physical reproduction. Transforming this inheritance by fire
to consciousness (air) frees one from the curse, as knowledge
and wisdom can be freely transmitted to anybody, independently
of physical relations. Say, if you write a book, that book would
be made of trees (earth), but if it reaches many readers, might
still transcend its matter by far.
</p><p>
Let me leave it at that for the fire signs for the moment.
I will explore such themes in more detail for each fire sign
further below. I hope you will agree in the end that this
simple model is in many respects a revelation, a marvelous
tool for doing astrology, useful for beginners as well as
for deep and broad explorations of psyche and life.
</p><p>
There is actually more to this, but let me first expose my model
for the other signs and elements.
</p>
<h2>Libra and Air Signs</h2>
<p>
In my model, air signs are different stages in a transition
fire-air-water. The archetypal image is a cloud (air) which
emits both lightning (fire) and rain (water):
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
Gemini is a young thunderstorm, with lots of lightning and
thunder, but little rain, yet. In contrast, Aquarius is an
old thunderstorm, with essentially only rain left. Libra
is in between.
</p><p>
Libra's dilemma of choice is an abstract one: There is no
earth involved in the above model. So Paris was neither
attracted by Hera's offer of great literal possessions nor
by Athene's offer to "make him victorious in all his battles",
but chose Aphrodite's promise of the love of Helena. Since
Libra is in the middle of a transition fire-air-water, the
choice usually is the latter, water, thus emotions, love.
</p><p>
There is a strive for clarity in the air signs. Gemini is
like a child in its quick and random motion, like flames or
lightning (fire), by which the child learns to understand the
world by looking at everything from all possible angles.
Take a coin for example. What the eye literally sees (fire)
is just different images, front face, back face, side view.
Only if you combine these images mentally in your head (air),
does an entity <em>coin</em>, come to be.
</p><p>
Or take Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to give it
to humanity. The universal love of Aquarius towards humanity,
is like the water in the rain that rains equally on everybody
and when it forms a lake, it evens out hills and valleys,
improving equality among mortals.
</p><p>
So, the evolution is from learning to teaching, from quickness
to constancy,  and from many views to a unified one, which is
transparent like water.
</p><p>
Libra's deep insights, probably due to their abstractness
and thus ignorance of the status quo (earth), often lead to
turmoil, like in the Troyan War or Teiresias' fate: By his
answer about a rather literal question, namely whether women
or men have more fun during sex, "Hera was so exasperated
[...] that she struck [him] blind", while Zeus granted
him "inner sight and the ability to understand the prophetic
language of the birds". Not astonishingly, in light of the
model, both gods agreed that his external vision (fire) had
to go in order to give him deeper insights.
</p>
<h2>Scorpio and Water Signs</h2>
<p>
In my model, water signs are different stages in a transition
earth-water-air. The archetypal image is a river:
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
Cancer is a source and young river emerging from the mountains,
maybe from a glacier (earth), and has not merged with much
other waters. As the water flows down, it merges with more
and more rivers and becomes a stream: Scorpio. Finally, Pisces
is the sea, into which practically all rivers flow and from
which the water eventually evaporates again (air).
</p><p>
So, the transition is, like for the fire signs, from earth
to air, but this time caused by a passive, female element.
The river that flows down to the sea is more fated than fire,
since it is passive, it cannot resist the movement.
</p><p>
Protection is a strong need for Cancer, but since there is a
transition to water, also the fight for independence from its
roots (earth) is an important theme. "This deeply mystical
linking of Cancer with the very seed and source of life
connects it not only with the primordial Mother, but with
the Father as well [...]".  Hera ordered a crab to bite
Hercules into his ankle while he was fighting the Hydra in the
swamps. Both the crab, who got his place as a constellation
for his obedience to Hera, and Hercules ("glory of Hera")
are part of the theme, as is also the Hydra and the swamps,
by the way.
</p><p>
Scorpio is already more open than Cancer, but still suspicious
and somewhat afraid to be hurt. "[...] I can see a great
deal of of Scorpion's <em>daimon</em>, which pulls violently
both upwards and downwards yet which [...] must confront
and ultimately learn to live with that vital and terrifying
image of instinctal life [...]". The conflict between
moving up and down is in the model between earth and air, or
between source and sea, and the way to go is ultimately down,
hence conscious evolution (air) is important.
</p><p>
Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu describes in the famous
<em>Autumn Floods</em> how a river feels so strong and
important and gaining power from the smaller rivers that
flow into it. When the river arrives at the sea, this all
changes, as the river realizes that size is relative, that
he is much smaller than the sea. Any influences that flow
into the river symbolically broaden the number of different
views that one incorporates, until in the end, in the sea,
all opinions and views occur with similar magnitude:
It has all become relative.
</p><p>
Again, this is, of course, very far from a complete and
unbiased description of the water signs, but, once more,
I hope that it has become clear how useful my elementary
model can be for investigating such themes, even if looking
much deeper into the soul than I did here...
</p>
<h2>Virgo and Earth Signs</h2>
<p>
In my model, earth signs are different stages in a
transition fire-earth-water. The archetypal image is a tree:
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
Taurus is mainly made of fire, focusses on the directly
visible, but short-lived beauties of the tree, the leaves
and flowers that grow with the power of the sun (fire).
Capricorn is mainly made of water, restrains himself to
the parts of the tree that persist across seasons and
which keep it from falling down, namely trunk and roots,
which feed it with water and the substances diluted in it.
</p><p>
Virgo is in between, not sure which to chose: Beauty or
structure ? This solves the riddle that even though Virgo
is often depicted as being very concerned about order, many
Virgos do not keep their lives and homes in strict order.
It is Virgo for whom order is an <em>issue</em>, for
Capricorn it is a <em>given</em> and for Taurus is not
that important, except a bit, as Taurus is transforming
from fire to earth.
</p><p>
Associated with beauty-order is also living vs. planning.
Taurus enjoys the moment, but plans little, while Capricorn
often keeps both an eye on the present and on possible
future paths. Virgo is again in between.
</p><p>
The abduction of Persephone by Hades fits the model very
well: Persephone is collecting flowers, looking at the
sunny (fire) side of life, but she is already starting
to look down to earth, probably at least unconsciously
starting to wonder about how things work, what makes the
flowers grow, etc. The ground opens up and Hades abducts
her and makes her his wife, the queen of the underworld.
</p><p>
Hades/Pluto is ruler of Scorpio, the middle water sign,
the one made mainly of water. So, Hades does symbolize
the water towards which Virgo is evolving in the model.
</p><p>
"Demeter and Persephone form a unity, the paradox of
woman as a maiden and a mother". The tree with its roots
symbolizes also the generational tree. Literally speaking
(earth), what emerges out of a woman's womb can be a man
or a woman, but men apparently disappear like leaves or
fruit from the tree, while women often bifurcate the tree
further if they have children. Therefore such
identification is a natural (earthy) thing for women.
</p>
<h2>The Model</h2>
<p>
Let me summarize the model in a table:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text"><strong>element</strong></td>
<td class="text"><strong>qualities</strong></td>
<td class="text"><strong>image</strong></td>
<td class="text"><strong>transition</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">hot+dry</td>
<td class="text">fire</td>
<td class="text">earth-fire-air</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">air</td>
<td class="text">wet+hot</td>
<td class="text">cloud</td>
<td class="text">fire-air-water</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">water</td>
<td class="text">cold+wet</td>
<td class="text">river</td>
<td class="text">earth-water-air</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">earth</td>
<td class="text">dry+cold</td>
<td class="text">tree</td>
<td class="text">fire-earth-water</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The listed qualities are according to Aristotle's views.
According to Aristotle, elements can only transform by
changing one of the qualities. For example, if you make
fire cold, you transform hot+dry to cold+dry, which is
earth. So the elements go in a cycle fire-air-water-earth-fire.
</p><p>
As you can see, the transitions proposed in my model are
all parts of Aristotle's cycle.
</p><p>
Also interesting is that the transition for each element
starts with a dry element (earth or fire) and ends with
a wet one (air or water). This can be associated with
the older age of star signs later in the zodiac. To Aries,
for example, a tree is often just a tree, just what the
eye can see (fire). To Sagittarius, in contrast, a tree
is often "Maya", just an illusion (air). It is probably
an experience of life that not everything is what it
appears to be at first.
</p><p>
What I only mentioned briefly with Libra and the air signs
is that there is always one element missing in each
transition. Thus, while Libra lacks realism in judgement,
Leo lacks compassion, Scorpio imagination and Virgo reason
(even despite the Mercury ruler).
</p><p>
Where do you go from here ?
Read the more detailed explorations of the 12 star signs below
and look at the leads, or make your own investigations, revisit
your favorite themes or the ones that you always felt that they
do not fit completely, and look at them from the point of view
of the model which has just been presented.
There is so much to explore and I hope and believe that all
these considerations will rather enhance than reduce the
richness of the zodiac.
</p><p>
One more thing should be mentioned: Since apparently nobody
has been aware of this simple structure, at least not in the
previous two thousand years or so, the existence of this
structure in what people <em>say</em> about star signs,
makes it rather <em>unlikely</em> that there is nothing to
astrology, that it would just be the <em>illusion</em> of
only a few, or many, delusional individuals, without any
connection to reality.
</p><p>
In fact, such a simple model could, of course, come in very
handy when it comes to proving astrology in quantitative
scientific experiments. What is usually ideal in science,
is a simple model that nonetheless spans the whole space of
possibilities, i.e. is simple, but not simplistic.
</p><p>
<em>It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all
theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and
as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate
representation of a single datum of experience. - Albert Einstein</em>
</p>
<h2>Myth and the Zodiac</h2>
<p>
In the following, I will simply revisit all themes and myths that
Liz Greene relates to the star signs in chapter 8,
<em>Myth and the Zodiac</em>, of <em>The Astrology of Fate</em>.
</p><p>
I will compare each theme with my elementary model of the star
signs. Often that will simply mean that I will relate an
expression that Liz Greene uses (or quotes) directly to the
corresponding <em>element</em>, using common associations,
like these:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text" rowspan="2"><strong>fire</strong></td>
<td class="text">energy of life, light, sun,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">vision, imagination, creativity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text" rowspan="2"><strong>air</strong></td>
<td class="text">mind, logic, spirit, abstraction,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">rationality, consciousness</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text" rowspan="2"><strong>water</strong></td>
<td class="text">feelings, love, beauty, fate,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">collective, unconscious, river</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text" rowspan="2"><strong>earth</strong></td>
<td class="text">physical reality, body, land,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">mother nature, tree</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
For example, when Liz Greene relates <em>"sunlit"</em> to Venus'
sexuality when talking about Taurus, I will associate that with
the element <em>fire</em> that Taurus is mainly made of in the model.
But let me start the journey...
</p>
<h2>Aries</h2>
<p>
In the model, Aries is a young fire, made mainly of earth, with
little fire and air, yet:
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
<strong>Amun</strong>&nbsp; Liz Greene starts by associating
Aries with the ram headed ancient Egyptian god Amun, mentions
that his name means "the hidden one" and uses attributes like
"primeval" and "the force behind the invisible wind".
</p><p>
Let me start to analyze with "wind", a form of air. Air is
part of the image of a burning fire in two ways: As the smoke
that emerges, but air is also needed to fuel the fire.
Especially when starting a fire one has often to blow (wind)
quite a bit and also has to protect the fire from too much
wind that might extinguish the small flame.
</p><p>
This associates Aries in the model with <em>wind</em>, and also with
the <em>protection</em> that a young life (fire) needs. Hence Aries'
knightly side, an urge to protect himself and anything weak. With
protection often comes <em>secrecy</em>, reluctance to tell (air)
things to others, as a means to protect himself and also others.
Hence "the hidden one" and the "invisible" (like air) in the
"force" (fire) "behind the invisible wind" make sense in terms
of the model.

<h2>leads</h2>
<ul class="leads">
<li class="leads"><div>In terms of my definition of the elements as
presented in the section <em>elementary philosophy</em>,
the model might even be made more specific to a degree
at which it might formally generate <em>all</em>
attributes of the star signs, or maybe not.</div>
Libra, for example, learns from observation of motion
outside (fire) and inside (water). Since Libra's transition
is towards water, the gift of "inner vision" is given to
Teiresias and outer vision had to be reduced, except for
observing omens, which are outer reflections of collective
inner intentions.
</li>
<li class="leads">Besides the <em>The Astrology of Fate</em>, there
are many more books by Liz Greene and others about
psychological astrology, which seem to fit my model
very well. The reason this approach seems to fit so well
might be that psychological astrology focusses on the
<em>motivation</em> of the star signs. It does not make
any certain predictions about what people and situations
will become, but 'only' about what people will feel in
a given situation, where they will feel to be driven to.
And it is exactly such transitions, the description of
where one comes from and where one is going to, that my
model provides. Specifically by Liz Greene about the star
signs, I can additionally recommend <em>Star Signs for Lovers</em>
(Stein and Day, 1980), later republished as <em>Astrology for Lovers</em>
and also a lecture titled <em>The Myth of the Individual Journey</em>
originally published in <em>The Jupiter/Saturn Conference Lectures</em>
(CRCS Publishers, 1984); the revised edition 1991 by the
same publisher is titled <em>New Insights on Modern Astrology</em>.
And, of course, there are the works of C. G. Jung, on
which a lot of Liz Greene's work is based.
</li>
<li class="leads">In <em>A few new discoveries in physics</em>, which
I first published in 2002, the model is exposed in a lot
more condensed way and goes deeper than this text.
See archive (odyssey.zip).
</li>
<li class="leads">Astrologically, the story how my model came to be seems
to be quite closely related to the Saturn-Pluto cycle.
