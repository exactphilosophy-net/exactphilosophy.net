<h1>space and time</h1>
<p>
Imagine that you have just now started to look at the
world.
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
One of the first things that you notice is space. There
is you and an outside world that you can see, and you can
see more than one thing. What separates you and what you
can see, and what separates the different things that you
see, is space in its most immediate definition.
</p><p>
Then you also quickly notice that some things move
and others do not. This is time, again in its most
immediate definition, as motion or being at rest.
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
Things can rest or move outside and inside the mind.
Thus there are a priori 4 different kinds of things:
What moves outside, what rests outside, what moves inside,
and what rests inside. Let me call them elements and give
them the following names: <em>emo</em>, <em>ero</em>,
<em>emi</em> and <em>eri</em>.

Some literature quotes, ideas and different points of view.
</div>
<ul class="leads">
<li class="leads"><div>Immanuel Kant. <em>The Critique of Pure Reason.</em> 1787.</div>
In the early chapters, Kant discloses that some observable
things cannot be isolated from the self, but instead appear
to be themselves a priori necessary for thinking and
observation. These a priori concepts include space and time in
their immediate sense - the structure in which things appear
in the mind and seem to exist outside of it.
</li>
<li class="leads">"By means of the external sense (a property of the mind),
we represent to ourselves objects as without us, and these all
in space. Herein alone are their shape, dimensions, and
relations to each other determined or determinable.
[...]
Space is not a conception which has been derived from outward
experiences. For, in order that certain sensations may relate
to something without me (that is, to something which
occupies a different part of space from that in which I am); in
like manner, in order that I may represent them not merely
as without, of, and near to each other, but also in separate
places, the representation of space must already exist as a
foundation.
[...]
We never can imagine or make a representation
to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though
we may easily enough think that no objects are found in it."
(translated by J. Meiklejohn)
</li>
<li class="leads">"Time is not an empirical conception. For neither coexistence
nor succession would be perceived by us, if the representation
of time did not exist as a foundation a priori.
[...]
With regard to phenomena in general, we cannot think away time
from them, and represent them to ourselves as out of and
unconnected with time, but we can quite well represent to
ourselves time void of phenomena."
</li>
<li class="leads">If I can imagine something, is it then really inside of me ?
Isn't there already a separation (space) between me and what I
imagine ? Such an extreme definition of self or inside would mean
that the self cannot have any attributes, no memory etc.,
because any attribute of the self would be something that can be
considered by the self and would thus, by definition, not be part
of the self...
</li>
<li class="leads">This definition of <em>self&nbsp;</em> reminds of the
<em>Tao&nbsp;</em> (way) in Taoism.
Lao Tzu starts the Tao Te Ching with "The Tao that can be spoken,
is not the real (unchanging) Tao".
</li>
<li class="leads">Would a female observer also consider what is seen as not
being part of herself or would she rather tend to identify with
what she sees ? In other words, is the distinction between in and
out hard or soft (gradual) ?
</li>
<li class="leads">What about sleep and dreaming, why only have a fully
conscious observer ?
</li>
