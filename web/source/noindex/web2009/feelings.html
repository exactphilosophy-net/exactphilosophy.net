<h1>long-range feelings</h1>
<p>
Everyday perceptions and science draw two completely
different pictures of what feelings are.
</p><p>
According to contemporary science, feelings are
electrochemical reactions in the brain, stimulated both by outer
influences like vision, sound, smell, taste and touch, and by
inner processes in the brain. Hence, as soon as you would
cut all contact with the person you love most - like walk
out of the room, close your eyes, cover your ears and stop
to breathe for a moment - science would consider any remaining
impression of being in love as merely an <em>illusion&nbsp;</em>
that is entirely restricted to your own brain.
</p><p>
In contrast, love is commonly considered to be a real
connection, a bond between two people that could hardly
be more real than what is experienced by lovers. Everyday
expressions suggest that feelings are something that is
actually <em>shared&nbsp;</em> and that compassion can actually
provide a real benefit to people who get compassion.
</p><p>
So, are language and everyday perceptions just lagging
behind modern science, just sentimental relicts from a more
superstitious medieval or antique past ? Or is current
science maybe unaware of something important ?
</p><p>
Let me tackle this question by playfully assuming that
feelings could reach far, many miles or more. More precisely,
let me assume that people's brains could communicate
even across some distance, but that such communications
would be <em>unconscious&nbsp;</em> to people and could only
<em>indirectly&nbsp;</em> be registered, namely in the form of feelings.
</p><p>
The idea is initially not to question this premise, but
instead to explore where it would lead and only a bit later
gradually start to get more and more critical. The results
of this Gedankenexperiment will be quite astonishing and,
even if in the end the initial premise turned out to be false,
perception of the world would likely have gained some very
compelling new possibilities. At the very least, it will be
much easier to speak in science about now rather metaphysical
terms like telepathy, precognition, fate and free will,
collective unconscious, god or gods, intelligent design,
astrology, divination, anima mundi, etc. since they will have
been given a new and quite specific meaning in the context
of this Gedankenexperiment.
</p>
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>
Assume in the following that the following would be true:
People's brains could communicate even when people are
large distances apart. This connection would be unconscious.
Consciously, the exchanged information would only be
indirectly accessible in the form of emotional reactions
to certain thoughts and actions. Let me make an example.
</p><p>
Joe Miller is about to sign a contract for a new house
he wants to buy for his family. Everything looks right and,
yet, Joe feels uneasy about the deal. Now, Joe's wife,
Heather, has a good friend Mary, who knows Carl who is
a plumber and did some repairs on the house and noticed
some veiled damage. Carl never talked about this to Mary,
nor does Heather know Carl, but unconsciously there might
have been more communication so that Joe's brain would
now unconsciously be aware of the veiled damage in the
house and cause him uneasy feelings.
</p><p>
In essence, life would not be clearly different from what
is observed every day. Joe would still not be able to
consciously read people's minds or to talk to them
telepathically, and he would still not be sure where
exactly his feelings would come from.
</p><p>
But the love he feels for his wife and his children etc.,
would be real, there would be a real connection that would
not leave him, only likely get weaker if goes to town for
work or travels to Europe or Asia.
</p>
<h2>Free Will and Fate</h2>
<p>
Joe would still be free to do and think whatever he choses
to do and think, but how he would feel doing it, would
depend on how other close people around him feel about
it. Since nobody can constantly do things that one feels
bad about, Joe would usually rather do and think things
that are in harmony with what others around him feel and
think. Conversely, his own wishes would also have some
impact on people around him.
</p><p>
Most likely close people like family and close friends
would be the strongest individual influences, but summed
up even lots of less related people, like everybody in the
same village or in the same country would likely also have
considerable influence on how one feels.
</p>
<h2>Collective Unconscious</h2>
<p>
Let me look at what has been said so far from a different
angle. If all brains are connected, then that is conceptually
not much different from how the human brain is built up,
namely from a large number of interconnected brain cells.
In analogy, all connected brains could thus be considered
to form some sort of a <em>meta-brain</em>.
</p><p>
Such a huge organism could - just like an ordinary
brain - potentially have a consciousness on its own, its own
thoughts, feelings and intentions. Since it would be so big,
it could potentially even have considerably more complex
thoughts than any individual person can understand.
</p><p>
This reminds of Jung's term <em>collective unconscious</em>.
Jung observed that in dreams and in cultural creations often
some <em>archetypal</em>, universal themes occur, even though
the directly involved individuals are usually not aware of
them, are not experts on, say, Greek mythology.
</p><p>
In terms of the postulated meta-brain, such themes could
simply be part of its knowledge, of its mental structures.
So dreams might provide more access to collective intentions
than conscious thoughts. This would also explain why dreams
often appear to be correlated with future events. Such
<em>precognition&nbsp;</em> might only be apparent, not real,
just reflecting collective knowledge and intentions. The
collective unconscious would have much more information
available to itself, so it could predict much more about
the future than would seem possible to any individual.
</p><p>
To some degree it is just a matter of speaking whether
one considers collective influences as influences from lots
of individuals or from one bigger identity. Whether Joe's
thinking is influenced by the shared wishes of all people
in his village or by a collective identity formed by all
collected brains in his village is to some degree
just a matter of taste.
</p><p>
In any case, there would in reality likely not be just a
single entity composed of all brains in the world, but instead
several entities on different scales, like family, village,
state, country, but also interest groups like political parties,
stamp collectors, you name it.
</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>
Such potentially "superior beings" remind, of course, of the
god or gods of various religions. I guess in reality, basically
these two views would emerge:
</p><p>
To atheists and agnostics, god or gods would simply be
identical to the collective unconscious entity that is formed
by the believers. There would actually be a real entity, but
its wisdom and power would be limited to the faith and number
of its followers.
</p><p>
Religious people would simply point out that god or the gods
made the world such that people can feel each other and thus
give each other support when they need it, and that that is a
very good thing.
</p><p>
I see no ways to experimentally decide between the two
views. Personally, I think that both views have their
advantages and disagreement would be smaller than today.
</p>
<h2>Astrology</h2>
<p>
Scientists usually turn away almost immediately when they
hear of astrology. But this might usually be based on a
wrong assumption, namely the claim that astrologers make
that what they are doing has something directly to do with
the stars and the planets in the sky.
</p><p>
Note that all following comments will be mainly about
mainstream Western tropical astrology, but similar and
equivalent comments could be made about practically any
other astrological system.
</p><p>
Take the twelve star signs of the zodiac. How to group
the stars on the ecliptic is a cultural choice, different for
example in China than in Europe. The Western constellations
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc. all have different sizes, only
very roughly representing 1/12 of the zodiac each, as assumed
in astrology. On top of that, due to the precession of the
earth's axis, star signs and constellations practically do
not overlap at all any more since quite some time.
</p><p>
This strongly suggests that the stars in the sky are not
correlated with astrological predictions and also suggests
that likely planets, whose tropical positions are precisely
calculated, are also not really correlated with what people
do down on earth.
</p><p>
But this has very little to do with how astrologers observe
astrology to work every day. Astrologers plot a birth chart,
some circles and lines and symbols. And then they interpret
the chart according to some rules and observe clear
correlations with people's lives and issues.
</p><p>
Suppose these correlations were real, suppose astrology was
simply a collective belief or in other words that the collective
unconscious enforces astrology by believing in it.
</p><p>
For Joe that would mean that, because he was born
with the sun in Aries, he would get more positive emotional
feedback when doing or thinking what an Aries typically
does in a given situation, but less or negative feedback
when not. So, Joe would again be free in principle, but in
practice would tend to think and act more like an Aries is
supposed to think and act.
</p><p>
What sense could it possibly make to hang on to such
an apparently archaic system as astrology ? Actually a lot
more than it might superficially appear. To the collective
unconscious, individuals would likely be a bit like ants to
us, unable to <em>see&nbsp;</em> the path they are walking on,
only guided by chemical traces to follow it.
</p><p>
Astrology ensures that given any problem, there will always
be a <em>balanced diversity&nbsp;</em> of approaches to it.
Depending on the solution, in retrospect it is often clear what
the best approach would have been: directly starting to
try something, or maybe first asking several people or even
reading a book, to go by feeling or by reason, and so on.
Joe will approach a problem like an Aries, Carl like a
Sagittarius with Gemini ascendent and Mars in Pisces, and
so on.  From an evolutionary perspective this makes sense
and is likely more efficient than no such system.
</p><p>
In the not so distant past it would likely also have been
useful that meanings of star signs are adapted to typical
things that need to be done in an agricultural society on
the Western hemisphere. For example, Virgo at the end
of summer likes to sort things out and stack them, like a
harvest, while Libra in early autumn prefers to trade and
balance things, like needed in order to balance stocks to
survive the coming winter, and so on.
</p>
<h2>Superposition</h2>
<p>
Different unconscious collective entities would have
different opinions on certain issues. For example, Joe's
family would like him to be more at home, but colleagues
from work or friends would have different interests. Such
interests would not logically exclude each other, but would
instead superimpose like waves, so that the stronger
influences would usually win Joe's decision.
</p><p>
In astrology, for example, there are different schools of
thought. Different systems of calculating houses, different
views what planets, aspects, houses means, which planets
or techniques make sense, and so on. In light of the above,
such different views would also not logically exclude each
other, they would only superimpose. Maybe if Joe lives in
a country where most astrologers favor Placidus houses, it
would usually best to cast a chart with this house system,
but if he married an astrologer who prefers Koch houses,
things might be different again.
</p><p>
From an experimental point of view, such superposition
would, of course, make formal tests more difficult.
</p>
<h2>Intelligent Design</h2>
<p>
If human brains are emotionally connected, so would most
likely also be animal brains, at least for fairly complex
animals like mammals or reptiles. Whether and to what degree
connections between species would be possible would most
likely depend on the specifics.
</p><p>
It is thus imaginable that the collective unconscious entity
for each species could have <em>plans&nbsp;</em> where to evolve its
species to. It could not influence which mutations occur,
but it might recognize useful ones and then guide individual
animals with such useful mutations, say, towards a region
with little predators and lead suitable mates to them.
</p><p>
In terms of Darwin's theory of evolution by random mutation
and subsequent selection, the collective unconscious could
influence the latter part and thus introduce some elements
of <em>intelligent design&nbsp;</em> to evolution.
</p><p>
In addition, even relatively simple life-forms could maintain
a significant collective culture, so that some behaviors
in a species might not even have to be coded into the genes.
</p>
<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p>
Time for a somewhat more critical look. Is it really
necessary to postulate long-range telepathic connections ?
What would already be expected with current physics ?
</p><p>
It looks like a lot could already be explained by postulating
two things, which are in principle even generally accepted:
When people meet, they not only exchange conscious information,
but a lot also happens unconsciously, is hidden in intonation
and gestures etc. And people could simply model in their own
brains how they would <em>expect&nbsp;</em> someone they love to
react in a given situation. Experience shows that such expectations
are often, but not always correct. In that case, if you walked out
of the room, closed your eyes, etc., feeling someone would be an
illusion, but based on lots of previously stored information,
of which you would mostly only unconsciously be aware.
</p><p>
Practically all of the mentioned phenomena could still
exist in this case. Expressed in terms of network technology,
a real-time network would have simply been replaced by a
store-and-forward network !
</p>
<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>
The postulate of long-range telepathic connections violates
explicitly two key assumptions in science: That effects can be
studied in isolation and that nature is less intelligent than
we are. Imagine a kid playing with ants, letting them walk onto
leaves and moving them around. The ants would have very little
chance to understand what is happening and certainly not <em>why</em>.
</p><p>
Imagine an experiment in which two lovers are separated (with
their consent) to different continents into labs in the desert
below ground. Give one of them something spicy to eat and measure
brain activities of both lovers. Normally, you would say that if
you find correlations, you have proven the existence of direct
telepathic connections between people and, if not, that such a
connection is very unlikely to exist.
</p><p>
Not necessarily in the second case, since collective resistance,
i.e. the collective unconscious not wanting us to know, could
have influenced the lovers enough to wash out any significant
results. No certainty without isolation.
</p><p>
Informally, the subjective impression that memories of very
emotional events evoke a lot less feelings when the person who
shared them is no longer emotionally related or even dead, hints
subjectively more at a direct connection than not, i.e. if you
remembered something like that, part of the unconscious
communication that took place then, would actually be
<em>repeated</em>, not just remembered. See also Kierkegaard's
<em>Repetition&nbsp;</em> in that respect.
</p>
<h2>Indirect Approaches</h2>
<p>
Maybe a more indirect approach could help to shed more
light onto these issues. Previous experiments regarding
astrology have essentially yielded negative results.
I can see two possible reasons for this.
</p><p>
Predictions by astrologers are usually in prose form,
often using quite flowery language. It is very difficult to
translate this material into a formal set of concrete
predictions that is then not too simplistic to work. And the
collective unconscious could guide researchers into directions
where nothing will be found.
</p><p>
In my personal experience, astrology works, but formalization
is quite difficult. Ideal would be a very simple model that
still makes lots of predictions and lots of data to apply
it to. This would make it difficult, hopefully impossible,
for the collective unconscious to hide its structures.
</p><p>
I think, I have found an interesting candidate system suitable
for such experiments, see rest of this site.
</p><p>
A great phenomenological diversity does not necessarily
prevent researchers from finding and proving a simple,
formal theory. Take chemistry, for example, which used
to be a craft surrounded by many untrue superstitions only
a few hundred years ago. Chemical reactions can totally change
the properties of the original substances, like a very aggressive
gas like clorine together with a metal that takes fire when in
contact with water like sodium forming together (ionized) just
regular salt. And, yet, chemistry is today an exact science that
is understood from first principles.
</p><p>
I would use the internet itself as a data source for
experiments. All data is already digitized and could be made
available by linking into large search engines, with consent.
Instead of birth data for real people, I would use founding
dates of web sites or the moment a first usenet post was
made using a given screen name.
</p><p>
Usenet seems especially suited for such experiments,
also since online conversations have a tendency to be
somewhat repetitive and stereotypical, which would most likely
make analysis easier. Specifically, the idea would be to
correlate content and timing of subsequent posts with what
astrology would predict by interpreting the chart of the
first post under a given screen name. In my personal
experience, different screen names make a difference even
when the same physical poster is behind them.
</p>
<h2>Anima Mundi</h2>
<p>
Let me playfully expand the scope all the way: Assume that
all matter, considered living or not by humans, would be
alive and conscious to some degree and that it would all
be interconnected. Joe, for example, would be <em>much
more&nbsp;</em> alive and conscious than his car keys, but even these
keys would have a little life and consciousness in them.
</p><p>
This is just the very old idea of a living world, of an
anima mundi or Plato's <em>world soul</em>.
</p>
<h2>Virtual Particles and Entanglement</h2>
<p>
The following is maybe more food for thought for physicists
than directly tangible for others. It is a somewhat far
fetched interpretation of quantum field theory that is not
in direct disagreement with experiment, but is also at the
moment not specific enough to be formally tested.
</p><p>
In quantum field theories, forces are mediated by the exchange
of so-called <em>virtual particles</em>. Virtual particles are
mathematical constructs that appear in calculations and share
some abstract properties with real particles, hence the
"particle" in their name. They interact with observed particles
and with each other, but by definition never with a measurement
apparatus, hence "virtual".
</p><p>
This makes it somewhat a matter of taste whether they should
be considered something that actually exists or just mathematical
tools. On the other hand, real particles in quantum field theories
are also quite abstract entities. Nobody has ever seen a neutrino
directly, nor even an electron, since it is photons that reach
the eyes. The rest is just a lot of logic based on experiments
and a few general axioms.
</p><p>
Unlike real particles, virtual particles are not bound by
the speed of light. The point in space and time where they
are created and the point where they are destroyed can be a
spacelike distance apart, i.e. farther apart than a real
particle could fly at the speed of light or slower. This implies
by the theory of relativity that which way the virtual particle
"went" is entirely a matter of perspective. One observer
would "see" the negative charge of an electron flying from
A to B, but another observer in relative motion to the first
would "see" the opposite charge, namely a positron flying
the opposite way, from B to A.
</p><p>
In that sense, it is not so that something is transported from
A to B or the opposite way, but it is still so that A and B are
connected. This reminds a lot of entanglement in quantum mechanics,
like in the setup of the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) paradox,
as follows.
</p><p>
Two photons with entangled polarization fly into opposite
directions. Two labs on each side, possibly light years apart
from each other, let the photons fly through polarization
filters with adjustable angle and into detectors. It has been
shown that experimental results exclude any local hidden
variable theories, i.e. theories in which both photons and
detectors have well-defined properties independent of
measurement and there is no faster-than-light communication
between the two labs, and even some non-local theories can
effectively be excluded.
</p><p>
What if entanglement and virtual particles were two
separate manifestations of the same underlying thing ?
</p>
<h2>Entanglement and Feelings</h2>
<p>
Maybe virtual particles or quantum mechanical entanglement
would be the mechanisms by which people could unconsciously
"communicate" ?
</p><p>
More precisely, there would not be any communication
from A to B or B to A, instead information would simply be shared.
Joe's love for Heather and vice versa would not be based on
unconsciously exchanged information, but they would simply
<em>share&nbsp;</em> some views and feelings.
</p><p>
Maybe people could create coherent quantum states in their
brains when they meet - how exactly would have to be explained
- and then, even when separated, could merely by thinking make measurements
with results that would then be bound to be mutually correlated.
</p><p>
Conversely, would virtual particles maybe correspond to
unconscious, collective activities, while real particles
would be related to individual consciousness ?
</p>

In terms of my definition of the elements as presented in the
section <em>elementary philosophy</em>, it would almost be expected
that things in the mind are not as clearly separated as things
in the outer world. The inner elements, emi and eri, are softer
than the two outer elements, emo and ero, which suggests inside
more fluidity, a tendency to <em>mix</em>. A priori such mixing
would not have to be restricted to the observing individual,
nor has a separation into different individuals been part of
the initial considerations. The cultural equivalents of emi and eri,
water and air, are associated with feelings and with communication
or thinking, respectively. In that sense, feelings could be
interpreted as the result of also unconscious communication,
in contrast to conscious communication channels.

In <em>The Astrology of Fate&nbsp;</em> (Weiser, 1984),
astrologer and psychologist Liz Greene provides many interesting
considerations around the nature of fate, of which many make
