<h1>science revisited</h1>
<p>
Various symbolic takes at exact science, mostly related to
physics: Its theories, how they emerge, and the people
involved. Minimal style teasers for scientists...
</p>
<h2>Architecture of Physics</h2>
<p>
Consider this table that divides the world into 4 different
concepts (inspired by the 4 classical elements):
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">(1)</td>
<td class="text">individual imagination</td>
<td class="text">("fire")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">(2)</td>
<td class="text">logical consequences</td>
<td class="text">("air")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">(3)</td>
<td class="text">collective wishes</td>
<td class="text">("water")</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">(4)</td>
<td class="text">physical reality</td>
<td class="text">("earth")</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
At first sight, the conclusion would likely be that physics is
made of (2) and (4), mathematical descriptions based on
empirical evidence, without any (1) or (3).
</p><p>
But let me look a bit more in detail into these concepts.
</p><p>
Mathematical theories are for all that it appears purely (2),
just logic, independently of any empirical observations.
Physics uses math to describe logical connections between
observed/measured <em>numbers</em>. In that sense, observation
or measurement is fundamentally the  process by which (4)
is turned into numbers, on which then (2) can operate.
This has the maybe somewhat unexpected consequence that math,
(2), can a priori <em>not</em> be applied to describe measurement,
simply because there are no numbers, yet.
</p><p>
The perception of what exactly is an acceptable measurement
in physics, is also not something that can be described by (2).
Acceptable measurements, like using a ruler or reading a dial
are just a minimal collective agreement, hence (3): the
minimal common denominator of which observations made by
different individuals can be considered independent of the
individual who makes them.
</p><p>
So there is a minimal amount of (3) in physics, and
individual observations may not always be free of (1), at
least that possibility cannot be formally excluded.
</p><p>
Research in physics usually involves quite a bit of (1) and
(3). Personal preferences and ideas, (1), are usually a main
motivator that determines the kind of experiments or theoretical
work a researcher conducts. Since research often needs funding
and some experiments, like most prominently in particle physics,
need machines bigger and more complex than any individual can
build in a lifetime, (3) is also an important practical
factor in research.
</p><p>
Of course, once a new theory is found, the (1) and (3)
elements involved in getting there no longer matter much. They
become at most a <em>matter of taste</em> interpretation of the
meaning of the theory, but they have no influence on specific
predictions made by the theory. So an established theory is
'condensed back' to mostly (2) and (4).
</p>
<h2>Structured Research</h2>
<p>
In light of the considerations above, good research would be
characterized by a <em>balance</em> of the concepts above.
If one component is underdeveloped, the chance to find new
science will typically be reduced.
</p><p>
There is a paradox contained in a paradigm of balance: If
everything is balanced, then nothing is biased, thus there is
an imbalance between being balanced and imbalanced. In that
sense, optimal research would be something that can only be
aimed for, but never provably reached.
</p><p>
To some degree, however, a balance of the 4 concepts helps
already <em>in itself</em>. For example, (3), typically leads
to 'fashion waves' in research, to extended periods in time
in which many people try to reach the same goal with similar
means. So (3) rather creates bias, (1) rather reduces it.
</p><p>
At the onset, it is never clear which approach will bring new
science. In low energy quantum mechanics, for example, relatively
astonishingly most progress has come from (2), from skillfully
applying the math of the theory, which lead to Bell's Inequalities
and Decoherence. Especially the latter is becoming important for
technical realization of a new breed of quantum mechanical devices.
</p><p>
In contrast, experiments (4) in that field have so far
always just reproduced what quantum theory predicts, not a
single exception has been observed. Thus in hindsight, the
energy invested in experiments was wasted. But only in hindsight.
Before conducting the experiments, nobody knew, and expectations
to find something useful by just applying the apparently so
simple linear theory seemed not to carry much potential
at the onset...
</p><p>
So, finding a balance will probably always remain a challenge.
What might help to reduce bias somewhat, though, would be to keep
an overview of research directions, ideally in a formalized way,
something like a global open database.
</p><p>
Ideally, such a database would also contain information about
theoretical and experimental approaches that lead nowhere, failed
attempts that today usually remain unpublished. Quickly, and maybe
anonymously, publishing what was tried and how and why it failed,
could spare other researchers some effort, in the interest of all
(3), but would, of course, sometimes also help immediate
competitors, hence would reduce (1) a bit. Such logic tail-biters
are what makes maintaining a healthy balance so difficult...
</p>
<h2>Science in Time</h2>
<p>
In astrology, all things are considered to be bound in their time
to some degree. This would include science and even astrology itself.
Let me look at the long term history of astrology and science from
the point of view of astrology, more precisely in terms of
astrological ages.
</p><p>
Due to the precession of the earth's axis, the star sign that rises
above the horizon on the ecliptic at sunrise at the beginning of spring,
changes about every 2150 years. That time span is believed by astrology
to be strongly colored by the respective star sign.
</p><p>
The last such transition was roughly around 0 CE and the next one is
due relatively recently in terms of the relevant time scale. So very
roughly the Age of Aries was until 0 CE, then the Age of Pisces until
about now, followed by the Age of Aquarius.
</p><p>
In my personal view, the second half of each age is increasingly
colored by the opposite star sign of the zodiac, i.e. Libra from
about -1000 to 0, Virgo from 1000 to 2000 and Leo might show from
about 3000 to 4000.
</p><p>
This would place the ancient Greek developments of mythology,
mathematics, philosophy, and also of a lot of astrology in today's
form, within the second part of the Age of Aries, influenced quite
heavily by Libra.
</p><p>
The association fits very well. Libra is an air sign, generally
considered to be related to logic, abstract thinking, mathematics, etc.
The zodiac of the ancient Greeks is an abstraction from constellations,
each sign has been given an equal part of the zodiac, and each sign
has an opposite sign with in many respects opposite properties,
opinions and approaches. Hence all opposites balance each other,
like in the scales that Libra stands for.
</p><p>
Modern science, in turn, has evolved in the second part of the Age of
Pisces, and would thus be colored by Virgo. Spurred by ancient knowledge
brought to Middle Europe during the crusades, during the renaissance
people started to analyze the outer world in all its aspects.
</p><p>
This fits well with Virgo, a quite pragmatic earth sign in astrology,
opposed to Pisces who is often afraid of knowing things in detail,
just like many people in the Middle Ages.
</p><p>
Initially, in science the primary focus has been on analysis, on
understanding how the world works. Technological applications have
only recently come into focus, maybe since about 200 years or so,
which would, again, fit very well with first signs of the Age of
Aquarius.
</p><p>
In astrology, Aquarius and its ruling planet Uranus, which was
discovered a bit more than 200 years ago, stand for progress, for
bringing knowledge in useful form to the masses, symbolized by the
water bearer Aquarius who is altruistically pouring water for all
of humanity.
</p><p>
Superimposed on that big picture in astrology, is the movement of
planets through the signs, which provides relatively short term
trends in society.
</p><p>
In recent years, several planets have dwelled quite a bit the sign
of Aquarius, which showed in a certain <em>industrialization</em>
of science. In the early 1990s when I was at IBM Research, a lot
of fundamental science was done there. In the past 20 years, however,
in most places, research has heavily shifted towards technology,
towards applying and refining already present knowledge.
</p><p>
As always, such bias is both good and bad. Likely being aware of it
can be useful and helpful. Even if one doubts that different times
are colored in the way astrology predicts, the set of opposites that
astrology defines can in itself be very useful for becoming aware
of contemporary bias.
</p><p>
You can then decide to go with the flow, which means usually easier
funding, but less prospects of finding something really new, or you
can try to go your own way, maybe with a few renegades with similar
interests. (1) or (3).
</p>
<h2>Fundamental Questions</h2>
<p>
If you had asked a physicist in 1900 if the future is predetermined,
the answer would have been:
</p><p>
"Yes, once you know position, momentum and mass of all parts of a
system - and these can be measured with arbitrary precision - you can
predict the full state of the system at any time in the future with
certainty."
</p><p>
Since about 1930 that has changed, due to new experimental data and
the development of quantum mechanics. So today's answer is the right
one ?
</p><p>
Nobody can tell for sure. The general reason is in the architecture
of physics: It is (2) based on (4). Hence whenever new observations
are made, the laws of physics can change fundamentally. Older theories
remain useful as approximations, like classical mechanics.
</p><p>
This makes science generally unable to answer any fundamental question
with certainty. But you can also get in many ways very close. Almost
certainly nobody would have come up with something of the subtle beauty
of quantum mechanics or relativity, had these structures not been
revealed by experiments and their subsequent analysis...
</p><p>
Arguably physics is a bit like democracy:
</p><p>
<em>Many forms of government have been tried and will be tried
in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect
or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form
of government except all those other forms that have been tried from
time to time. - Winston Churchill in 1947</em>
</p>
<h2>Measurement Inside</h2>
<p>
Current perception is that an objective measurement of things inside
the mind is not possible. Of course, a 1 : 1 transposition of the way
things are measured outside is not helpful. Imagine, say, measuring the
height of an imaginary oak tree with an imaginary ruler. You cannot
give your ruler to the next guy so that he can measure his imaginary
oak tree and then compare the results.
</p><p>
However, most people would agree that one can imagine an oak tree and
that one can imagine a ruler. So there is common ground of a somewhat
more abstract kind.
</p><p>
How the color red appears in my head and how it appears in yours might
be completely different things, but the concept of colors and of a
color red is shared.
</p><p>
So maybe a science based on <em>words</em> and their relations would
be possible: A mapping of shared inner concepts onto words, which can
then be shared and handled outside and inside the mind. This would
likely lead to a more scientifically structured description of symbols
than previously (Freud, Jung, astrology, etc.), and maybe in points
similar to some other things I am playing with on this web site.
</p><p>
Anyway, here are two maybe a bit exotic ideas related to inner and
outer observations.
</p><p>
The first one is based on the experiences with observing dreams that
Richard Feynman describes in <em>Surely, you're joking, Mr. Feynman!</em>
(Bantam Books, 1985). While dreaming, often fantastic things seemed
possible, like to see a hair in much more detail than would be possible
with the naked eye. But when awake, such experiences seemed to have been
merely illusions. I suppose this was also the reason why Feynman
eventually gave up on this.
</p><p>
There is a possible twist however. Feynman observed that one can
influence what happens in dreams to some degree. So, why not try to
dream of future events, and maybe even gradually in ways in which
any other explanation than real precognition can be excluded ?
</p><p>
It would not matter then if observations during such dreams were
objective or anything, all that would matter would be if what you
wrote down afterwards would correlate with future events.
Too far out ? Here's the second idea...
</p><p>
Currently, some physicist disagree about whether quantum mechanics
is an important part of how the brain works, at least in terms of
creating a conscious mind. Does any coherence in the brain decay
almost immediately due to interaction with the environment, or is
coherence a key necessity for life and consciousness ?
</p><p>
Well, maybe that question can be answered with a stopwatch. Algorithms
have been developed that would allow a quantum computer to solve certain
tasks quicker than any classical computer. Hence, if the brain is a
quantum computer, maybe some people can solve certain tasks quicker
than would be possible with a classical brain. And that could be
measured, with simple means.
</p>
<h2>3+1 in Nature</h2>
<p>
Many things in physics come in 3+1. Three dimensions of space plus time.
Three components of momentum plus energy, which are all independently
conserved. Three forces in nature have been unified, electromagnetic,
strong and weak interactions, but the fourth force, gravitation, seems
to be different: spin 2 symmetry (hence no negative charge), intertwined
with space and time, very weak.
</p><p>
A belief that 'the fourth is different' is apparently quite old and
related to the number &pi;, which is believed to be related to perfect
harmony because it links the diameter of a circle to is circumference,
and the circle was often considered the most perfect geometrical figure.
In that view, the first 3 things are similar, but the fourth is bound
to be different, in fact about 4-&pi; &asymp; 6/7 different from
the other three.
</p><p>
If you toss 4 coins, the chance to get 3+1 is really bigger than any
other result:
</p>
<table class="text">
<tr>
<td class="text">4+0</td>
<td class="text">2/16</td>
<td class="text">0.125</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">3+1</td>
<td class="text">8/16</td>
<td class="text">0.500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="text">2+2</td>
<td class="text">6/15</td>
<td class="text">0.375</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
And if you use coins with skew probabilities you get this distribution
that suggests the same:
</p><p>
[image]
</p><p>
But if you do the same with 3 coins, you get a similar result, too, i.e.
'the third is different'. And with more coins, it simply turns out that
the maximum is near the middle, at (n/2+1)+(n/2-1) if n is even and
at (n/2+1/2)+(n/2-1/2) if n is odd. So, no, that
cannot be the reason for 3+1 in nature, at least not that alone.
The question remains open.
</p><p>
But maybe it has still some predictive power. There are three known
families of quarks and leptons in particle physics. The existence of a
forth and similar family can be pretty much excluded at the moment,
but a <em>sufficiently different</em> fourth family can, of course,
not be ruled out and might even appear in future experiments.
</p>
<h2>Sun and Discovery</h2>
<p>
Let me finish with something more closely related to astrology, but applied
to theories in physics and their discoverers. It is, in my view, amazing
how precisely the sun sign of discoverer and the symbolism of the theory
often match.
</p><p>
Let me present some examples. I am assuming that you are either familiar
with some basic sun sign astrology or have read the corresponding parts
of this web site.
</p><p>
Niels Bohr had the sun in Libra. His principle of complementarity, a
fundamental inseparability of wave and particle properties in quantum
mechanics, fits Libra, which balances opposites, very well, also in
further aspects.
</p><p>
Albert Einstein had the sun in Pisces. It is a general attribute of the
last water sign, Pisces, to consider practically everything in the world
relative, which fits obviously with Einstein's most famous discoveries.
</p><p>
Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger and Paul Dirac both had the sun in Leo, which shows
in the similar equations they discovered and in the similar ways in which
they did this.
</p><p>
Werner Heisenberg, who had the sun in Sagittarius, discovered the same
basic laws of quantum mechanics as Schr&ouml;dinger, but in his matrix
calculation formulation the perception of nature is fundamentally
different: In the Schr&ouml;dinger picture, the wave function evolves and
operators are constant, in the Heisenberg picture, it is the other way
round. This fits again very well with the more philosophical perceptions
of Sagittarius as opposed to Leo.
</p><p>
The interaction picture in quantum mechanics is between the two, reminding
of Libra, which is in the middle between Leo and Sagittarius in the zodiac.
</p><p>
The reason the sun sign apparently shows so prominently in these discoveries
is that the sun is typically considered in astrology to be related to things
that people put their heart into. What exactly that is, may often not be
obvious in the life of a person from outside, but if it is a major discovery,
then it usually comes to light.
</p><p>
Of course, astrology would also allow to look in more detail into how and why
discoveries came to be. In the case of Einstein, interesting topics might be
why 1905 was so fruitful for him and for which reasons he gave the money of
his Nobel Prize to his first wife...
