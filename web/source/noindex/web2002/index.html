<h1>Welcome to exactphilosophy.net</h1>
This web site is about a few new discoveries in physics.<br>
<h2>Discoveries</h2>
<b>Abstract</b><br>
<br>
A new physical effect is described.
Human brains are emotionally interconnected.
The connection is directional with spin 1 symmetry and can be felt across global
distances and through the earth.
The exact physical nature of the effect remains unknown.
Selective sensing of virtual photons, i.e. of electro- or magnetostatic forces,
might be part of a future theoretical explanation.<br>
<span class="white">m</span>
Based on the discovered effect, a plausible explanation of phenomena like telepathy
and precognition is given.
It is also made plausible how astrology and other ancient mythological beliefs
have persisted unconsciously until today and continue to influence our fates
by means of collective emotional feedback.<br>
<span class="white">m</span>
The western astrological system is shown to be essentially composed of simple,
opposing principles which originate from ancient greek philosophy.
There are two main discoveries.
Meanings associated with the star sign, different inner planets were in
at birth time, influence how one relates to different classes of people.
The meanings associated with star signs themselves derive from
different mixtures of the four classical elements, more specifically,
from meanings associated with transitions from one element to another.
The discoveries are simple and specific enough to be verified quantitatively.<br>
<span class="white">m</span>
Finally, some fundamental scientific and philosophical problems are
discussed in light of the new discoveries.<br>

<b>About me</b><br>
<br>
<a href="alain97.jpg">I am</a> a physicist and live in Switzerland near
<a href="http://www.zuerich.ch/">Z&uuml;rich</a>. I was born there in 1966 and
have studied physics at the Swiss Federal Instititute of Technology in
Z&uuml;rich (<a href="http://www.ethz.ch/">ETHZ</a>). Then I have worked for four
years at the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/">IBM Z&uuml;rich Research Lab</a>
in R&uuml;schlikon for my PhD. After that I have spent one and a half years at
McGill University in Montreal, Canada, working on the
<a href="atomic/index.html">same stuff</a> as at IBM. Currently, I am working
80% for <a href="http://www.it-sec.com/">iT_Security AG</a>, a company in
Z&uuml;rich that makes smart card based security software. During some of the
rest of my time, I have made the discoveries disclosed here. Here is a more
formal <a href="cv.html">curriculum vitae</a>.<br>
