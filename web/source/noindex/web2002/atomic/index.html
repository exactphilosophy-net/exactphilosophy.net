<p>
The aim of this project is to investigate the interaction between a tip
and a sample which are characterized on the atomic scale. In scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) and related methods, it is usually not vital
to know the atomic structure of the foremost atoms of the tip. In
measurements, however, where forces are measured close to the surface
(say where wavefunctions start to overlap) or when contact is made, the
exact atomic arrangment of the foremost tip atoms becomes important for
an accurate interpretation of the measurements. Conducting such
experiments with an atomically defined tip would allow comparison with
theoretical calculations for the first time without qualifications.
</p>

<p>
The project was started in 1991 by Urs D&uuml;rig and Alain Stalder
(then a predoc) at the IBM Research Laboratory in Switzerland. The basic
idea was to build a machine that would allow to prepare tips with atomic
precision using methods from field ion microscopy (FIM). Previously, it
had been demonstrated by H.-W. Fink [1] that [111]-oriented W tips can
be prepared to form pyramids that end with only one atom at the apex.
</p>

<p>
The machine we built was essentially defined by the experiments we
wanted to perform with it.

<a id="Instrumentation"><img alt="" src="instrumentation.gif"></a>

<p>
In order to obtain clean surfaces, the instrument must be in ultra-high
vacuum (pressure below 1e-10 mbar). Furthermore the instrument has to be
cooled to cryogenic temperatures in order to limit surface diffusion on
tip and sample and also to obtain FIM images with good contrast and
resolution. We have chosen to cool with liquid nitrogen, which should be
sufficient for many experiments. It is important to measure the
interaction force between tip and sample independently of the tunneling
current (which serves as a measure for the tip-sample distance). In
addition the force sensor must be able to detect forces of the order of
nN with cantilever beams (CBs) that have spring constants of the order
of 100 N/m. Hence CB deflections of the order of 0.01 nm have to be
detected.
</p>

<p>
We have chosen to use a differential interferometer based on the
Nomarsky principle [2]. In short a calcite crystal is used to split a
laser beam into two mutually orthogonal polarization states (see figure
below). These two beams are reflected on different spots on the CB and
merge back into one beam again. A CB deflection causes a phase
difference between the two that can be detected in a straightforward
way.
</p>

<p>
An important point in the design of the instrument was that the
transition from STM/AFM to FIM operation had to be quick. In particular
we wanted to avoid transferring the tip away from the STM for doing FIM
because this increases the chance of the tip becoming contaminated. The
basic geometrical setup is shown in the figure below.
</p>

For a detailed description of the instrument (and tip preparation) see
[3]. A description of another important element of the instrument,
namely a combined liquid nitrogen cooling and damping stage can also be
found in [4]. In order to get an idea of how the instrument looks like,
click the image below for some scanned photos and drawings.

<a id="TipPreparation"><img alt="" src="tippreparation.gif"></a>

<p>
Tips are first electrochemically etched from [111]-oriented W wire and
then transferred into the vacuum chamber, where they are cleaned by
heating and self-sputtering.
</p>

<p>
Imaging by FIM constists of applying a high positive voltage to the tip
(typically a few kV) while the vacuum chamber is filled with about 1e-5
mbar of He gas. Electrons in the He gas tunnel to the tip; the created
He ions are repelled from the tip and can be detected on a screen.
</p>

<p>
When the imaging voltage is increased, atoms on the tip start to "field
evaporate". This process can be used to evaporate several layers of the
tip, a few atoms at a time. In general, field evaporation tends to make
the tips rounder. By carefully heating the tip, however, the three (110)
planes can be made to grow, thus forming a sharper tip.
</p>

<p>
Click the FIM image below to see how it can be used to infer the 
structure of the foremost atomic layers of the tip.

evaporation steps.

<p>
Note that the tip shown here was in vacuum during about a month. During
that time it had been prepared repeatedly to the same atomic arrangment
of the foremost atoms.

<p>
In July 1995 the machine had been built (with technical help by Meinrad
Tschudy who built most things inside the vacuum chamber except the
actual STM/AFM/FIM) and single crystal W tips had been prepared by FIM.
Furthermore the STM/AFM worked at low temperature in ultra-high vacuum
(see STM image below), however not with the single crystal tips that had
been prepared using the FIM. At the end of 1995 the machine was donated
to the group of Peter Gr&uuml;tter at McGill University. Now Graham
Cross and Andr&eacute; Schirmeisen (both graduate students), Alain
Stalder (postdoc) and Peter Gr&uuml;tter are pursuing the project in
collaboration with Urs  &uuml;rig of the IBM Research Laboratory in
Switzerland.

<p>
The STM image above shows a [111]-oriented Pt surface at 140 K recorded
with an Ir tip. Several atomic steps are visible in the scan area of 100
nm by 100 nm.
</p>

<a id="Outlook"><img alt="" src="outlook.gif"></a>

<p>
As a first experiment we intend to measure the adhesion force between a
[111]-oriented W tip with known atomic structure of its foremost layers
and a single crystal sample, probably a thin metal film evaporated onto
a glass CB. Another simple experiment would be to make and break a
metallic contact with this tip-sample system while measuring both
current and interaction force. After breaking the contact, both tip and
sample could be investigated for modifications. It is worthwhile to
mention that macroscopic phenomena like adhesion, friction and wear
(which are of great technological importance) are based to a large
degree on contacts of nanometer size dimensions (so called
"asperities").
</p>

<p>
A vast field of investigation is the manipulation of atoms or molecules
on the sample surface. Manipulation has already been successfully
demonstrated in several systems. Forces are usually not measured and
certain aspects of manipulation are up to now more on the stage of a set
of recipes than of theories. As the apparatus we built could allow us to
manipulate atoms or molecules with an atomically defined tip and would
also allow us to monitor the forces that occur while manipulating, we
would have a unique tool to improve the understanding of the nanoscale
world. A bit more far fetched, one could then start to search for
candidate systems for use in nanometer-sized devices, i.e. systems
having certain properties that can be described by rather simple
theories, a property that is often a prerequisite for technological
usefulness.
