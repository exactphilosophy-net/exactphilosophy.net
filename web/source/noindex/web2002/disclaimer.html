The document consists essentially of a list of scientific hypotheses, i.e. of
questions to nature that have been formulated in a way that allows experimental
scientists either to ask them directly to nature or, else, to divide them into
sub-hypotheses by means of known techniques and then to ask those to nature in
experiment. If, and only if, a hypothesis is experimentally confirmed and
generally accepted by the scientific community, will it become a scientifically
verified fact.<br>
<span class="white">m</span>
If you apply any hypotheses as facts to your life or to the life of others, you
are doing it exclusively at your own responsibility and at your own risk.<br>
