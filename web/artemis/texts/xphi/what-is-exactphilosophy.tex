\section{What is exactphilosophy\,?}

A new word for the dictionary that I would define maybe like this:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{quote}

\textsl{exactphilosophy} n.\newline

\vspace{-2.5mm}
\footnotesize
A way of doing philosophy that aims at eventually producing scientific hypotheses,
while avoiding internal inconsistencies (or making them explicit)
and correcting factual errors whenever detected.
%
It avoids to make things too specific unless they are carefully settled,
influenced by ancient Asian traditions, especially by the Tao in Chinese philosophy,
and by pataphysics.
%
It could be imagined as floating around ‘reality’ like a magic carpet,
while gently trying to settle down,
with a care similar to the proverbial fox in China crossing a river on thin ice.
\end{quote}

\vspace{-0.5mm}
\noindent
Note that this is about \textsl{exactphilosophy}\hspace{-0.2mm}
in \textsl{one} word and \textsl{not} capitalized.

The adjective would be \textsl{exactphilosophical},
the adverb \textsl{exactphilosophically},
the verb \textsl{exactphilosophize}.
Privately, I often abbreviate exactphilosophy as \textsl{xphi}
or even, more rarely, as \textsl{x}$\varphi$.

\subsection{A bit more exactphilosophically, …}

…\ exactphilosophy
is intended to be a \textsl{word in the dictionary},
a name given to a novel concept
that did previously not exist in this form,
but it is not a brand or organization,
hence never in competition with anything like that.

The fox icon of exactphilosophy.net
is related to hexagram Wei Chi (64) of the \textsl{I Ching},
especially as translated and interpreted by Wilhelm/Baynes,
which is closely mirrored in the definition of exactphilosophy above.

Taoism is related to xphi;
you might even playfully substitute xphi for tao
in the first chapter of the \textsl{Tao Te Ching},
but many things fit, like e.g.\ chapter 66,
or Zhuangzi’s “magic pearl”
in Wilhelm’s translation to German,
and more…

Another important influence was Kant’s
\textsl{Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science},
and others of Kant’s works,
making xphi also akin to metaphysics.

Also much related is Alfred Jarry's \textsl{Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien},
hence pataphysics,
which,
for example,
contrary to metaphysics as defined by Aristotle,
would also include singular events.

Note also that the fox in the logo of my website is not alone,
but closely and harmoniously accompanied by some sort of “p” comet
\includegraphics[scale=0.025]{../i-comet.jpg} or something,
and vice versa,
a combination I call “foxyfox”,
by the way.

My Saturn is slowly retrograde at the end of Pisces (end of winter, Wei Chi)
in the 9th house, with Chiron just a few degrees behind,
so both aware of the diversity of the whole cycle and hopeful for spring,
like the gentle fox on ice.

Roseanne Roseannadanna’s fable of the Egyptian fox.
