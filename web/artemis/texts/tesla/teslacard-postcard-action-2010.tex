\section{Teslacard Postcard Action 2010}

In early summer 2010,
as some kind of art project codenamed \textsl{Teslacard},
I sent about 250 postcards to astrologers and astrological organizations worldwide,
including to many well-known ones (see the books exactphilosophy.net 2017, 2019 or 2020 for a complete list).
%
The postcards sketch my elementary model of the star signs
in terms of transformations of the elements,
which I first publicly postulated in 2002.

Images and photos of the postcards below.
