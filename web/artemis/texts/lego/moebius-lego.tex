\section{Möbius lego}

Two variants of the same idea from this website in 2009.

On the following pages to the left the newer version,
probably at least initially written with only my left hand,
to the right the older version.

I still think the idea is beautiful.

The idea consists essentially of “condensing”
all secrets of the world into something like a Möbius strip
as an alternative to “elementary particles”,
so that the most elementary components of the world
would already contain the deepest secrets,
which can maybe never be resolved anyways.

Both versions are also part of the copy of my website of 2009,
although the older version is somewhat hidden there.
