\item[2004]
Idea to define \textbf{\color{xphi}elements in terms of in/out (space), rest/move (time) and their transitions}.
%
First time publicly visible 20 May 2004 at 00:24:44 UTC,
in a post titled simply “Disclosure”
to the Usenet newsgroup alt.astrology.tropical.
In the post,
which I had posted 19 May 2004
about 15 minutes before midnight Swiss time,
I say that I had the idea “last Wednesday (2004-05-18)”,
which in my view would have been Tue 18 May,
but maybe was Wed 12 or even 19 May.

Specific idea how to arrange trigrams in a circle

%
4 Aug 2016 in the evening in Adliswil.

Mailed to dozens of historians world-wide.

%

Advertised in half a dozen astrological publications world-wide,
six public reviews.

{\color{darkgray}%
Switched (temporarily until Dec 2019)
to a new, more formal potential definition of emo
as the difference between two images taken in short sequence.
%
September.}

\item[2019]
Cover design {\ELEMENTAL}. January.

‘\white{White}-\red{red}-\black{black} and the\,\green{“green”}\,goddess’.
%
April.

Publication of the book \textsl{exactphilosophy.net 2019}.
%
May.

Renaissance of the original idea.
{\color{darkgray}%
Moved the formal definition of emo/ero of 2018 to a later section (now in ‘measurement’),
as it seems not fundamental enough
to reflect the immediate experience of being.}
%
December.

\item[2020]
Passing away of my dear parents Romeo+Suzy.
%
January/February.

Circumstantial evidence for how colors
white-red-black relate to fire and moon,
going back far into prehistory,
and likely led to classical Greek elements.

Possibly some steps closer
to describing the star signs in terms of transformations
between elements defined purely in terms of in/out and rest/move.

Publication of the book \textsl{exactphilosophy.net 2020}.
%
November.

Idea that the psyche may operate almost exclusively along the circle of elements.

Publication of the pocket book \textsl{Space, Time, Elements at exactphilosophy.net}.
December.

Realization that Apuleius’ tasks of Psyche likely draw more on Plato’s philosophy
and later philosophical ideas than on mythology.

\item[2021]
Idea that outside ero is more inert and thus ‘heavier’$\!$/denser than emo,
and inside emi is more inert and thus ‘heavier’$\!$/denser than eri;
idea that in prehistory eri and emo
would have been a single experience of life in the psyche,
thus at first only three elements,
colored white-red-black.
%
January.

Realization that findings thus far
regarding the core idea
of elements in terms of in/out, rest/move and their transformations,
have now reached “critical mass”;
their equivalence to ancient elements can now be shown
practically without gaps.
Maybe a conclusion, a natural end of my research has been reached.
%
February.

Publication of the pocket book \textsl{Space, $\!$Time, Elements at exactphilosophy.net},
Second Edition.
%
April.

\href{https://www.exactphilosophy.net/sleeping-beauty-dreaming.pdf}{\color{xphi}Sleeping Beauty Dreaming.}

Publication of the book \textsl{exactphilosophy.net}.

Article \textsl{Cargo Cult Astrology}, also in German.
%
Published in December.

\item[2023]
Core web in German. 8 July 2023 at 20:32 CEST Adliswil.

Special article \textsl{Amber’s seen and not Heard prank\,?}
%
July.

\item[2024]
Publication of the book \textsl{exactphilosophy.net} (edition 2024).
%
January.

Conscious insight that my approach around the core idea
is generally via a \textbf{\color{xphi}contemplating self},
for which outside things tend to rest and making them move tends to require energy,
while inside things tend to move and making them rest tends to require energy,
whereas for a self that gets drawn into a chain of thought
that chain of thought would usually appear both moving and active.
%
October.

Via ‘contemplatio’ and ‘theōría’,
Plato’s cave seems to be more closely related
to my perspective on active/passive inside
than expected.
%
29 October.

Sleeping Beauty Dreaming of \ELEMENTAL\,…

\item[2025]
{\color{darkgray}Core idea most likely unrecoverably gone, no future.
%
Maybe a little bit of future for smaller ideas on the side.
%
But they are already published.}

Publication of the book \textsl{exactphilosophy.net} (final edition 2025).
%
May.

Since then I hope to kiss Sleeping Beauty
and awaken her from her ‘dreams’
such that the original idea would return
in at least close to its original beauty.

Changes,
except tiny fixes,
since the 2025 book
from ‘way’ to ‘dreams’
in {\color{odyssey}blue}.

\newpage

Realization that since a few years
I have been rendering this website
using the original {\smaller\TeX}/\includegraphics[scale=0.025]{i-metafont.png} mechanisms,
via \texttt{modes.mf},
which I read as that sometimes,
especially regarding this website,
doing more and new stuff is neither necessary nor good,
and this made me happy.
%
18 December.
