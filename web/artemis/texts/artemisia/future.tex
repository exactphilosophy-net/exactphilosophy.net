\section{Future}

Strange as it may be,
doing nothing seems to be the best thing
for me and the things I discovered.

Or not quite,
I guess I will write \ELEMENTAL\
and might even advertise it,
but otherwise,
best to keep essentially at rest,
just wait.

I guess today (Easter 2023)
I even got used to the new Felseneggturm a bit,
viewed from the botanic garden in Zürich.

You know,
when Jim Morrison met Ray Manzarek
at Venice Beach at the beach
most likely after the weekend of the 4th of July 1965,
Ray thought that this was by chance,
while in his ‘roman à clef’
likely the Fates made him turn a similar situation
involving the Angels/Angles
into something where Jim is sort of manipulated into going to India, etc.,
but apparently Ray never considered that Jim,
after writing some poem songs,
was probably looking for musicians,
and, of course, Ray was maybe the first choice.

But that is certainly not the whole story,
all the Doors were special,
especially in combination,
including also at least some of the women involved,
and so on.

In California,
the dreams that reached an end
after all the way west
not only turned into movies at Hollywood,
but most likely also into the Internet and more.
