\section{way of the fox}

In summer 2025,
I had the idea to just do what I might have done
if I had just discovered my core idea or “way”,
and then published a website \href{https://wayfox.ch/}{\color{xphi}wayfox.ch}
with the following content,
featuring a two-tailed kitsune
(or download as \href{https://www.exactphilosophy.net/wayfox.zip}{\color{xphi} wayfox.zip}):

The font is ‘Alte Haas Grotesk’,
Helvetica with simulated bleeding,
and very basic modern html
with dark mode support and a WebP image,
with the idea to have just a single page
with none of the complexities of this site with La\hspace{-0.05em}TeX plus html.

The idea of changing one’s fate via ‘virtual reincarnation’
certainly has quite a bit of appeal,
while it is maybe more surreal than real\,…\hspace{-0.1em}?
