\section{Are dark matter and energy neutrinos\,?}

Neutrinos were first proposed by Pauli in 1930
to explain energy and momentum conservation in beta decays.
%
Dark matter and energy were proposed to explain something invisible
that can similarly not be explained with known matter and forces.
%
Could they be the same thing\,?

Every second,
a gazillion of neutrinos are flowing through every cubic inch in the universe.
%
Since relatively recently
neutrinos are also know to carry a little bit of mass.
%
Might they carry something else in similarly tiny quantities
responsible for the effects associated with dark matter and dark energy\,?

This is simply \textsl{Occam’s razor}.
%
With neutrinos there would already be something largely invisible that permeates the universe.
%
So why not look there first for an explanation of the effects
associated with dark matter and dark energy\,?
