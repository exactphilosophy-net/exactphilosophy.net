\section{Delphi for Palm\,OS}

In the year 2000,
I wrote an astrology program called \textsl{Delphi} for Palm\,OS handheld devices,
which not only allowed to display horoscope charts,
but also to tap on shown elements,
for example,
in order to show only aspects to a certain planet.
%
In order to calculate planetary positions
and to get coordinates and time zones for places world-wide,
I wrote an astrological software library called \textsl{astrolib}
to go with Delphi.

Moreover,
in the about screen of Delphi,
I placed cryptographic hashes and digital signatures
in order to be later able to to prove
that I had already formulated certain ideas at the time.

\subsection{Details}

Delphi and astrolib were first published 7 October 2000.
%
The initial versions of Delphi were black and white
and astrolib contained information for about 350 locations around the world.
%
In 2001,
first support for synastry relationship charts followed,
then color charts
and in astrolib data for about 2000 additional locations world-wide.

The screen resolution available to Delphi was only 160 $\times$ 160 pixels:

\noindent
In order to still be able to display a lot of useful information,
it was possible to tap on practically all visible items on the screen:

\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\leftmargin}{13pt}}
%
\item Planets in the chart or in the list to the right,
to show for example only aspects to the Moon
and to show its position with arc minutes in the list.

%
\item Aspects, to show for example only squares.
\vspace{-2mm}
\item Star signs,
for example,
to show only planets in Leo.
\vspace{-2mm}
%
\item The house symbol in the upper left corner,
to switch to a view with houses instead of aspects.
\vspace{-2mm}
%
\item Houses,
to show only planets in a certain house,
as well as the the position of the house cusp.
\vspace{-2mm}
%
\item The clock symbol in the lower left corner,
to display a chart for the current time,
for a selectable location and time zone.
\vspace{-2mm}
%
\item The name in the top right corner,
to edit birth data.
\end{list}

\noindent
Preferences allowed to define orbs
and to select a house system (Placidus, Koch or no houses).
%
It was even possible to “beam” charts between devices
using the integrated infrared beamers.

Delphi was relatively successful,
many thousands of downloads.
%
I once saw an astrologer who used it on his PalmPilot
and it also appeared on several CDs that often came with magazines at the time.
%
In the book \textsl{“PalmPilot and Palm Organizers! I Didn’t Know You Could Do That…”},
Second Edition, by Neil J.~Salkind, 2001,
Delphi is mentioned in the book
and Delphi 1.21 is included on the accompanying CD.

A few technical details:
Delphi used routines I wrote myself in order to draw circles,
as well as dashed and dotted lines,
because the former,
as provided by the OS,
were too slow,
and the latter did not exist at all.
%
Astrolib compressed Unix tz data a lot in order to remain compact
and since the memory stack was so small,
some astrolib functions had to use static variables
instead of parameters and local variables.

Hidden in the about screens of Delphi,
I placed cryptographic hashes and digital signatures
of some of my own original works about the world,
including astrology,
which I had not yet published at the time.
%
In the three images below,
each time the Apollon temple at Delphi in Greece is shown,
but the apparently noisy underground differs each time
and contains the respective cryptographic hashes and digital signatures:

Here is the web site for Delphi at the time.

By the way,
the image at the top shows the temple of Athena Pronoia at Delphi:
