# exactphilosophy.net

This repo contains the source of my website
[**exactphilosophy.net**](https://www.exactphilosophy.net/).

With the following omissions:

- `artemis/perma/web*.zip`
- `source/noindex/books/{xphi|ste}*.pdf`
- `source/noindex/odyssey/{usenet|astro|yijing|babylon}{.html|/}`
- `source/shared/vnu/vnu.jar`

It is mostly pdfLaTeX and HTML with images, built with basic bash.

I am first publishing this in late December 2025 also to set sort
of a fixed point, influenced by what Donald E. Knuth did in 1990
with the trinity TeX, METAFONT and Computer Modern fonts:

- Donald E. Knuth. [_The Future of TeX and METAFONT_](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb11-4/tb30knut.pdf).
  TUGboat, Volume 11 (1990), No. 4.

I may publish an <span style="color:gray">exactphilosophy.net series</span>
of pocket books in the future, most likely immediately based on LuaLaTeX
with the font Alte Haas Grotesk, but that would only marginally influence
the website, and I still hope to do some research, never say never.
